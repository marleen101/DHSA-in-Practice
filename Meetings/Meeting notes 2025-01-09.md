# Supervisor meeting January 9th
Feedback:
- In general, idea is nice and works 
- Topic modelling works but may not pick up on bias; software doesn’t matter
- Consider different methods, etc. (analyzing frames, topic modelling, depiction of entities, dehumanization (cf. Carissa Chew’s vocabulary: word count), also comparing methods)
  - If small dataset, can do deeper linguistic analysis 
- Good visualization is important!
- Making a work schedule could help 
- Start small and go from there (one article per source)
  
Next steps:  
- Set independent variables: which articles (span of dates, events, etc.), country, different algorithms, analysis unit (paragraphs, texts, etc.), news outlets
- Think about methodology 
- Make work schedule(?)
