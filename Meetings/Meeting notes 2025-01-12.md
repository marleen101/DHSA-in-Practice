# Group meet
Did:  
- Criminology: 1970 switch in pov: from “perpetrators need help” to “victims need help, perps need punishment” -> chronological comparison
- Using UK outlets -> seem to have more variability than e.g. US ones
- Looking at critical discourse analysis to inform methodology choices

Next steps: 
- Meet on the 13th, make suggestions for RQ (incl. which media outlets), organize meeting with Maddalena, literature research
