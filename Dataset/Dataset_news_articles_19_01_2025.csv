Article 1;www.bbc.co.uk;Israel-Gaza: Why this war is different to the others;None;;war, israel, gaza, israelgaza, egypt, allies, different, way, thousands, jordan, israels, palestinians;"Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war.
They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea.
The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians.
All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt.
As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel's allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be ""difficult and messy"".";"The border between Israel and Lebanon is heating up, slowly and steadily. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah want a full-scale war. But as they trade increasingly heavy punches, the risks of uncontrolled escalation will grow.

The Houthis in Yemen have been launching missiles and drones towards Israel. They have all been brought down, so far, by Israel's air defences or by US Navy warships in the Red Sea.

In Iraq, militias supported by Iran have attacked American bases. The US retaliated at some of their sites in Syria. Again, all sides are trying to limit escalation, but controlling the tempo of military action is always difficult.

On America's side are Israel, the Gulf oil states, Jordan and Egypt. The US continues to give strong support to Israel, even though it is clear that President Joe Biden is uncomfortable about the way Israel is killing so many Palestinian civilians. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said publicly that too many Palestinian civilians are being killed.

America's Arab allies have all condemned what Israel is doing and called for a ceasefire. The sight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing their homes in northern Gaza and walking down the main road south raises the ghosts of Israel's victory over the Arabs in its independence war in 1948.

More than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes at gunpoint by the Israelis, events referred to by Palestinians as al Nakba - the catastrophe. The descendants of the 1948 refugees include much of the population of the Gaza Strip.

Dangerous talk by some of the extreme Jewish nationalists who are supporting the government of Benjamin Netanyahu about imposing another Nakba on Palestinians is alarming Arab states in America's camp, particularly Jordan and Egypt. One minister in Netanyahu's government even mused about dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza to deal with Hamas. He was reprimanded but not sacked.

All that can be dismissed as the ravings of the lunatic fringe, but it is being taken seriously in Jordan and Egypt. Not nuclear weapons, of which Israel has a large and undeclared arsenal, but the prospect of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forced over their borders.

As for the war itself in Gaza, senior western diplomats from countries that are firm allies of Israel's allies, told the BBC that ending the war, and dealing with the aftermath will be ""difficult and messy"".

One said that ""the only way through will be rebuilding a political horizon for Palestinians"". That was a reference to an independent Palestine alongside Israel, the so called two-state solution, a failed idea that survives only as a slogan.

Reviving it, perhaps in the context of a wider accommodation between Israel and the Arabs, is an ambitious plan, and perhaps the best idea around. But in the current atmosphere of pain, alarm and hatred it will be very difficult to deliver."
Article 2;www.bbc.co.uk;Bowen: Five new realities after four weeks of Israel-Gaza war;None;;unknowns, realities, war, unknown, bowen, things, israelgaza, shape, world, way, work, talked, understand, weeks;"Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield.
Fears that the war could spread are very real.
New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond.
Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of ""unknown unknowns"".
But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference.";"One of the first things to understand about the reportage, analysis and commentary that has poured out since the Hamas attacks of 7 October is that no-one has the full story. Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged.

Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond.

Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of ""unknown unknowns"".

The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media.
They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.

We're pausing our live coverage for the next few hours, so until then, here's a quick recap on where things stand in the war between Israel and Hamas.

Palestinians have continued to flee Gaza City as Israel steps up its ground offensive.

The Israeli military said 50,000 Palestinians have fled the city today, as its forces once again opened a safe passage on the main north-south road for several hours.

Yesterday, Israel said it had surrounded Gaza City and cut the strip in half – today it said Hamas had “lost control” of northern Gaza.

Hamas-run authorities in Gaza reported several airstrikes in both the north and south of the territory, with the number of people killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October rising by more than 200 to 10,569 in the last 24 hours.

Strong words from the UN continued, with both Israel and Hamas accused of committing war crimes by the UN commissioner for human rights.

And UN Secretary-General Anontio Guterres said the number of civilians killed in Gaza showed something was ""clearly wrong"" with Israeli military operations, but also said Hamas was using people as human shields.

Meanwhile, as families of some 239 people taken hostage in Gaza during the Hamas attacks continue to push for their release, the BBC heard from a source close to talks about the captives.

Discussions are taking place over a possible release of 12 hostages, half of them Americans, in exchange for a three-day humanitarian pause in fighting, the source said, adding that disagreement remained over the length of the pause and the situation in the north of Gaza.

But Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed ""false rumours"" and said there would be no ceasefire ""without the release of our hostages"".

The BBC's International editor, Jeremy Bowen, has travelled with Israeli forces into Gaza - he didn't see a single building that wasn't badly damaged and was shown a building containing both a family apartment and what the military said were weapons-making workshops.

We continued to hear about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with people there struggling to find enough food and water.

However, a convoy carrying medical supplies reached Gaza City’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa - where medical conditions are “disastrous” - Unrwa and the World Health Organization said. It was just the second delivery to the hospital during the month-long conflict."
Article 5;www.bbc.co.uk;Israel's Palestinian prisoner release a 'window of hope' in West Bank;None;;prisoners, security, west, told, zughary, hope, window, occupied, israels, lawyers, release, prisoner, palestinian, palestinians, israeli, bank;"The return of 39 Palestinians from Israeli prisons to their homes in the occupied West Bank was never just going to be a family affair.
A quarter of the population of the West Bank has spent time in an Israeli jail; it is a shared experience.
And more than 3,000 people have been arrested since the 7 October attacks - including almost 900 children - according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club president, Abdallah Zughary.
""Most of them are civilians, not affiliated with any kind of political party or militant group,"" Mr Zughary told me.
A spokesperson for the IPS told the BBC that over the past few weeks, ""four national security prisoners died"" in different circumstances and on different days.";"By nightfall, the road in front of the Beitunia checkpoint had the feel of a restive festival, the sting of politics and tear gas mingling in the air.

Small campfires flickered in front of a handful of green Hamas flags; there were many more Palestinian ones.

The return of 39 Palestinians from Israeli prisons to their homes in the occupied West Bank was never just going to be a family affair.

Israel's jailing of large numbers of people on security grounds is widely seen by Palestinians as a tool of the occupation.

Charges range from murder and violent attacks on Israelis to stone-throwing. Many Palestinians say Israel is criminalising acts of resistance by an occupied people - the Israeli Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC all prisoners are detained ""according to and under the provisions of the law"".

And more than 3,000 people have been arrested since the 7 October attacks - including almost 900 children - according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club president, Abdallah Zughary. Many of these detainees have been placed in administrative detention without charge, he says.

""Most of them are civilians, not affiliated with any kind of political party or militant group,"" Mr Zughary told me.

""Since 7 October, there have been no visits by families or lawyers to prisoners. And six prisoners have died."" He accuses Israel of using the justice system as a ""revenge policy"".

A spokesperson for the IPS told the BBC that over the past few weeks, ""four national security prisoners died"" in different circumstances and on different days. ""We have no knowledge of the causes of death,"" they added.They refused to comment on the suggestion that families and lawyers had not been allowed to visit prisoners."

More than 4,000 of those killed were children, the ministry said.

The number surpasses the UN's figure of about 5,400 killed in Gaza in all of Israel's previous conflicts with Hamas since it took control of the territory in 2007.

Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed 1,400 people and kidnapped more than 200 others on 7 October.

It says it is destroying Hamas infrastructure and killing its fighters so that it will no longer be able to pose a threat to Israel.

US President Joe Biden has previously questioned the accuracy of the health ministry's figures, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say that ""any information provided by a terrorist organisation should be viewed with caution"".

Hamas is a proscribed terror organisation in many countries including the UK and US.

However, World Health Organization (WHO) regional emergency director Richard Brennan, based in Cairo, said last week he believed the figures provided by the health ministry were trustworthy.

""We're confident that the information management systems that the ministry of health has put in place over the years stand up to analysis,"" he said, adding ""the data over the years has been quite solid"".

On Sunday night, the Israeli military carried out one of its heaviest bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip, saying on Monday that it had hit 450 targets over the past 24 hours.

The Hamas-run health ministry said ""more than 200 martyrs were reported in the overnight massacres"".

The director of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City told the BBC that people were using donkeys and their own cars to carry dead bodies, because communications had been cut and they could not reach ambulance services.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) charity said this was the ""third communications blackout"" in Gaza since the war began - and it had lost contact with its teams.

Communications were restored on Monday morning, but getting information from Gaza City remains difficult.

The Israeli military says its troops have reached the coastline in the south of Gaza City, in effect dividing the territory in two.

The heads of all major UN agencies have issued a rare joint statement calling for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", saying ""enough is enough"".

""For almost a month, the world has been watching the unfolding situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory in shock and horror at the spiralling numbers of lives lost and torn apart,"" the UN chiefs wrote."

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of operating from tunnels underneath Al-Shifa, which Hamas denies.

A video verified by the BBC showed a woman filming herself at the Al-Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, where she claimed that the children’s hospital was being “besieged” by tanks and full of people told to evacuate.

And the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that hospitals in northern Gaza have ""reached a point of no return"", risking the lives of thousands of people.

In an exclusive interview with the BBC this evening, French President Emmanuel Macron said Israel must stop killing babies and women in Gaza, but Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu responded that world leaders should be condeming Hamas, not Israel.

The Hamas-run health ministry says 11,078 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war and more than 27,000 others are injured.

Away from Gaza, in the West Bank, dozens of people attended the funerals of 11 Palestinians killed in a reported Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp.

It all comes after Israel launched a retaliatory offensive in Gaza as a response to Hamas's deadly 7 October attacks, which killed around 1,200 people while more than 240 others were taken hostage.

Israel revised the death toll down from 1,400 on Friday because, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Lior Haiat, many poeple killed were not immediately identified after the attack, and ""now we think those belong to terrorists... not Israeli casualties""."

South African sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back to the days of late anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.

The government has announced the withdrawal of its diplomats from Israel, and suggested that the position of Israel's ambassador to Pretoria was becoming ""untenable"".

This has been sharply criticised by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies which has called for an urgent meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa.

South African sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back to the days of late anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.

He famously said in 1997, three years after he became the country's first democratically elected president after decades of struggle against white-minority rule: ""We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.""

The unprecedented Hamas attack on Israel, which killed some 1,400 people, has not changed the position of the country's ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), even though two South African nationals were among the dead and another is among the more than 230 people taken hostage.

President Ramaphosa has pledged the ANC's solidarity with the Palestinians, saying their history had echoes of apartheid, external - and South Africa's struggle against white-minority rule.

Although he did condemn the Hamas assault, a week later he led 60 party leaders as they waved Palestinian flags, while wearing the traditional chequered black and white Palestinian scarf, the keffiyeh.

""They are people who have been under occupation for almost 75 years,"" he said of the Palestinians. ""They have been waiting and waging a war against a government that has been dubbed an apartheid state.

""We have always pledged our solidarity, and have always insisted that the only solution, especially with the issues of Palestine, is a two-state solution.""

South Africa's foreign ministry has gone even further, suggesting that the Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 10,000 people, might amount to a genocide, external.

In the statement announcing the withdrawal of its diplomats, Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor accused the Israelis of imposing ""collective punishment"" on Palestinian civilians - an allegation rejected by Israel.

The government has not commented on the South African hostage, or named them.

Its pro-Palestinian position has been condemned by the country's Jewish Board of Deputies, the South African Zionist Federation and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA).

Because of the passionate views on both sides, some South African talk radio stations have deliberately limited airtime around taking calls from listeners keen to discuss the war between Israel and Hamas.

Large pro-Palestinian protest marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.

Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Last Friday members of the Jewish community hung up 221 big red balloons across Johannesburg's Nelson Mandela Bridge to bring attention to the Israeli hostages and call for their release."

The most serious incident was an Israeli raid overnight in the city of Jenin, in which five were killed.

The Israeli army said it was mounting a raid to capture a Palestinian who was suspected of involvement in an ambush that killed two Israelis in August.

Palestinian factions have called for a strike in Jenin to mourn those killed.

The West Bank has seen almost daily clashes for more than a year and a half, after Israel suffered a wave of deadly violence by Palestinian militants.

Israeli forces have gone into West Bank towns and cities in search of those suspected of being involved in shootings and stabbings or planning such attacks.

Jenin has been a flashpoint, and hundreds of Palestinians - both fighters and civilians - have been killed.

Back in July, Israeli forces launched an incursion into the city's refugee camp, which is regarded as a hotbed of militants.

Thirteen Palestinians were killed in the fiercest confrontation in the West Bank for 20 years.

In addition, Israeli settlers have responded to killings carried out by Palestinian gunmen with rampages in Palestinian towns and villages.

So, the area was already at boiling point before the Hamas assault on Israel on 7 October.

In the weeks since then, the UN says some 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or settlers in a new escalation of the conflict. Four Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.

Even as Israel has been fighting a war with Hamas in Gaza, it has tightened its controls on the West Bank in a bid to prevent a spill-over of the conflict.

But this appears only to have further undermined the Palestinian Authority and boosted the rise of militant groups in Jenin and beyond."

No-one in Israel is saying exactly how long the war will last. Some point to the fact that it took nine months for Western-backed Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS)group in 2017.

The ministry also gives figures for the injured and the missing. Some of the bodies remain trapped under piles of rubble, says the Palestinian Red Crescent.

Health ministry officials say the death figures are recorded by medical professionals before being passed on to them and the figures only include people recorded dead in hospital. The figures do not distinguish between military and civilian deaths. And, because they do not take into account those who died at the scene of blasts whose bodies have not been found, or buried immediately, they may be an undercount, Gazan officials say.

That point was amplified by the Biden administration last week, when a senior US official said the death toll was likely to be greater than the numbers being reported.

""We think they're very high, frankly,"" Barbara Leaf, assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, told a House Foreign Affairs Committee, ""and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited.""

It stands in stark contrast to the view of Mr Biden himself, who, on 25 October, said he had ""no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed.""

However, he did not provide any evidence for his scepticism.

A day after Mr Biden's dismissal of the numbers, the health ministry in Gaza provided more information, publishing an extensive list of names of all those who had been killed between 7 and 26 October. The list included more than 6,000 full names with their ages, sex and ID numbers.

How was it compiled? The BBC has spoken to people involved in gathering and organising the data as well as an academic who has checked for duplicates on the list of names.

We have also spoken to an independent research group, Airwars, which is in the process of matching deaths it has investigated to names on the health ministry's list, and the UN - which has assessed death figures in Gaza during previous periods of conflict."

Hostage death

The body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, who was abducted by Hamas during its attacks on 7 October, has been found by Israeli forces in a structure close to Gaza's largest hospital.

Yehudit Weiss was recovering from breast cancer when she was taken from kibbutz Be’eri, according to campaigners. Her husband, Shmuel, was killed by Hamas gunmen.

Earlier, the BBC heard from a journalist at the hospital who said:"" Soldiers are everywhere, shooting in all directions."" Before his phone line cut out, he told us armoured bulldozers had been brought in.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of housing a command-and-control centre in a tunnel network underneath the hospital. Hamas denies this.

The hospital's director warned of ""tragic"" conditions inside. He said the facility had run out of oxygen and water, with patients ""screaming from thirst"". Read more on this here.

In Gaza’s south, leaflets were dropped by Israeli forces over Khan Younis, warning people in four towns to evacuate their homes and head to shelters.

For most of the day mobile phone and internet services were down across the Gaza Strip because of a lack of fuel, according to Palestinian telecoms companies. We've written up the story here.

Fuel shortages are also causing significant problems for the delivery of aid throughout the Strip. The UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) has said that, from Friday, it will be unable to send trucks to pick up supplies for Gazans from the border with Egypt.

In the West Bank

Israel said its security forces had killed three gunmen who opened fire at a checkpoint on a road leading into Jerusalem from the West Bank.

Israel says one of its soldiers was killed and others were wounded. Hamas's armed wing said it carried out the attack.

Gaza is ""fast becoming a graveyard for children"", the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) has warned.

Speaking on Monday, António Guterres warned that the situation in the enclave ""more than a humanitarian crisis, it is a crisis of humanity"".

""Hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day,"" Guterres told a news conference, on the eve of the first full month since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, and the Israeli military responded with retaliatory strikes.

Guterres again called for an immediate ceasefire.

His remarks were criticised by Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen, who wrote ""shame on you"" on X - formerly known as Twitter - tagging the UN boss in the post.

""More than 30 minors - among them a 9 month-old baby as well as toddlers and children who witnessed their parents being murdered in cold blood - are being held against their will in the Gaza Strip,"" he said, adding:

Quote Message Hamas is the problem in Gaza, not Israel's actions to eliminate this terrorist organisation.""

As the fighting enters its fifth week, it shows no sign of easing, with the latest figures from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry suggesting 10,022 people have now been killed in the enclave - including 4,104 children - since Israel's campaign began. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 200 others.

Criticism of pause time: Families of those being held in Gaza have said every captive ""needs to come home"", but the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa said a four-day pause - in which more aid would be allowed to go into the enclave - is simply not enough.

Aid crisis: Lorries carrying aid are now queuing up at the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza in anticipation of the pause in hostilities. Earlier, the executive director of Unicef - the UN's agency for children - said Gaza now faces a crisis of ""child wasting"" - a term used to describe the most life-threatening form of malnutrition.

Any attempt to accommodate hundreds of thousands of displaced people, in an area seemingly lacking in essential infrastructure - there are no hospitals - will present the UN with a mammoth humanitarian challenge, including the setting up of emergency shelter, most likely tents.

It is also a moral challenge with deep historical resonance - much of Gaza's population is descended from refugees who lived in tents after they were expelled or fled Israel in 1948.

The second video, filmed at the main courtyard of a primary school in Beach refugee camp, also in northern Gaza but near the Mediterranean coast, shows a plume of smoke rising from behind the main building of the school.

Several people, including children, run for safety in the courtyard, while some residents of the camp watch from the windows above. A series of explosions can be heard in the background of the video. The last one, the loudest, causes the crowd in the courtyard to flee in panic.

Hamas authorities in Gaza blamed Israeli air strikes. The IDF has not yet commented.

UN-appointed experts have called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, saying time was running out for Palestinian people there who find themselves at ""grave risk of genocide"".

""The situation in Gaza has reached a catastrophic tipping point,"" they said, warning that a ban on fuel entering Gaza and disruption to water supplies meant people had little access to safe drinking water.

""Water is essential to human life and today, two million Gazans are struggling to find drinking water,"" they said.

The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva called the comments ""deplorable and deeply concerning"" and blamed Hamas for civilian deaths.

Footage of the releases shows Red Cross staff, in their distinctive white vests emblazoned with its internationally recognised emblem, taking the hostages from masked gunmen, carefully helping them into their vehicles, giving them first aid and even playing with children in their first moments of freedom.

The organisation was in contact with Hamas ever since it seized about 240 people during its massive attack on Israel on 7 October and took them back to Gaza. It has repeatedly called for their release, or at least to allow the ICRC to visit them.

So far, 58 hostages - 40 Israeli and 12 Thais - have been released to the ICRC. The organisation was not involved in the negotiations around the terms for a release, but was standing by to facilitate the release once those terms had been agreed.

From Israel, there has been some criticism that the ICRC has not done more.

But the organisation said ""the ICRC cannot force its way in to where hostages are held, nor do we know their location"".

The statement reflects frustration in Geneva that not everyone understands what the Red Cross can and cannot do.

It is trying to fulfil its traditional role under the Geneva Conventions, asking to visit the hostages, deliver medical supplies, and bring news to desperate families. None of that can happen unless both Hamas and Israel agree. The ICRC is unarmed, and relies entirely on the trust of the warring parties - and civilians caught up in conflict - to carry out its work.

And in the same way as it has transported hostages out of Gaza, it has also taken to their West Bank homes Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange.

Local media said a fourth civilian who had mistaken for an attacker and shot by the troops died later died.

In its statement saying that two assailants were its members, Hamas said Thursday morning's attack was a response to Israeli ""crimes"" in Gaza and elsewhere.

Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen almost eight weeks ago, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.

Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.

A deal mediated by Qatar has led to a pause in the fighting in Gaza since last Friday.

The Jerusalem attack came hours after the Palestinian armed group - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - agreed with Israel to extend a truce in Gaza for a seventh day, and to allow another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.

Eight hostages were released from Gaza on Thursday. Two women - Mia Schem and Amit Soussana - were initially released, followed by a group of six others.

Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning the expected number of 10 was reached.

It reiterated that a further 30 Palestinians were due to be released from Israeli jails in return.

Talks have continued in an effort to further prolong the pause in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his third trip to the Middle East since fighting broke out with Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October.

In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, Mr Blinken called on Israel to put in place ""safe"" zones for Palestinian civilians in central and southern Gaza before resuming any military operations.

The point, he said, was to ""minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".

The Palestinians and Israelis of H2 are separated in some places here by just a few feet, and surrounded by cameras, cages, checkpoints, concrete blast walls and rolls of razor wire.

For more than 40 days now, since the Hamas attack on Israel, 11 Palestinian neighbourhoods within H2 - comprising about 750 families - have been under one of the harshest lockdowns imposed on the area for more than 20 years. H2's population is almost entirely Palestinian, but the district is under the total control of the Israeli military, which has for the past few weeks been forcing Palestinian residents back inside their homes at gunpoint.

We've just heard from our correspondent Anthony Zurcher in Ireland, where the US secretary of state's plane is refuelling on the way to Israel.

His arrival come just hours after the country's president, Michael D Higgins, made a vocal intervention warning against the ""collective punishment"" of people living in Gaza.

He concluded that if the world is to move past this conflict, a consistent, diverse body of proposals on the region's future should be put forward.

The proposals, he says, are ""ones that can deliver a reasonable security to citizens of Israel, and at the same time achieve the delivery of the long-neglected rights of the Palestinian people""."

Live reporter

We're pausing our live coverage for the next hour or so, so here's a quick recap on where things stand in the Israel-Gaza war.

Fourteen Israeli and three foreign nationals were released from Gaza today.

Among them was Abigail Idan, a four-year-old girl with joint Israeli and US citizenship. Both her parents were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel that triggered the war.

President Biden welcomed her release, saying she had been through terrible trauma.

Israel freed 39 Palestinian prisoners in return. Crowds gathered in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank to welcome them home.

The exchange comes on the third day of a fragile four-day pause in fighting. Gazans have been using the opportunity to get in much-needed supplies of fuel food and medicine.

The BBC's Lucy Williamson says that both sides appear to be edging towards an extension to the current pause.

Hamas has said it is seeking to extend the truce and increase the number of hostages released – 24-hours before the current deal expires.

And a senior Palestinian official has told the BBC that Hamas told negotiators it was ready to extend the pause by up to four days.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has talked about his ""framework"", under which the release of 10 extra hostages could lead to another day of pause in the fighting.

But he also said that after the framework ends Israel will return to its goals, which include the elimination of Hamas.

But it did not seem so extraordinary at the start.

Soon I was struggling to absorb the impact of what I was saying on-air, even as the words left my mouth.

The intense missile fire which had me running in and out of the office air raid shelter turned out to be a cover for an unprecedented, complex, long-planned series of attacks.

We saw shocking images of Hamas fighters riding motorbikes through holes cut in Gaza's perimeter fence, paragliding into southern Israel, storming heavily fortified military bases and filming themselves in the gardens of overrun kibbutzim.

Over painful hours, partygoers called into Israeli TV stations describing massacres as they hid from gunmen at the now notorious Nova Music Festival. Terrified residents shared videos of armed Palestinian squads on the streets of Sderot.

It was to prove to be the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history with people murdered systematically and ruthlessly. From some of the kibbutzim close to Gaza, footage later emerged showing the cold-blooded massacre of entire families. Ultimately, some 1,400 are estimated to have been killed.

The significance of the timing was not lost - as this onslaught came almost exactly 50 years after a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, sparked a major regional war.

The raw pain and shock for ordinary Israelis, still evident now, was on full display when I went to Ashkelon on 8 October.

China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, discussed the conflict with officials in Washington at the weekend amid fears of a bigger regional war. The US has pledged it would work with China on trying to find a resolution.

Mr Wang has also spoken to his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts after China's Middle East special envoy Zhai Jun flew to the region to meet Arab leaders. It has also been one of the most vocal proponents of a ceasefire in UN meetings.

There are hopes China could tap into its close relationship with Iran, which backs Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, to de-escalate the situation. US officials apparently pressed Mr Wang to ""urge calm"" with the Iranians, reported the Financial Times.

China is Iran's biggest trade partner, and earlier this year Beijing brokered a rare détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Tehran says it ""stands ready to strengthen communication with China"" on resolving the situation in Gaza.

As the Chinese government has had a relatively balanced relationship with all actors in the conflict, they could be perceived as an honest broker, said Dawn Murphy, an associate professor who studies Chinese foreign policy at the National War College under the US Department of Defense.

In particular, China has positive relations with the Palestinians, Arabs, Turkey and Iran, she said. ""Together with the US which has good relations with Israel, they could bring all of the players to the table.""

But other observers point out that China remains a minor player in Middle East politics.

The Christian population of the small coastal strip has a long history. St Porphyrius was a fifth century bishop of Gaza whose tomb lies under the church.

Hagari points out various pieces of “evidence” - including a cache of weapons laid out on the floor - that he says shows that the area was used by Hamas fighters to store weapons and hold hostages.

A key item is a document on the wall which he says shows a schedule for fighters guarding hostages. The top of this document mentions the “al-Aqsa flood” – Hamas’ codename for the 7 October attacks.

Hagari calls it a “guardian list, where every terrorist writes his name [and] has his own shift”. However, the Arabic words actually translate to the days of the week, not names.

He also points out a curtain hanging over a white-tiled wall, which he says could be used as a backdrop for hostage videos. Of the hostage videos released by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad which we have seen so far, none have shown a matching pattern in the background.

BBC News has not visited the site and is not able to independently verify any of the allegations made by the IDF.

Hamas denies hiding under the cover of hospitals - a longstanding Israeli allegation. Its health ministry called the video ""a theatrical farce""."

Israel has been bombarding Gaza for over a month and began a major ground offensive almost two weeks ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.

If he loses to Donald Trump, the chances of reviving the two-state solution are close to nil.
One state is unrealistic, said Yehuda Shaul, co-founder of Ofek, an independent Israeli thinktank dedicated to advancing a two-state solution.
The two-state solution remains the only viable one we know Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chiefThe Palestinian public would soon re-embrace a two-state solution, said Husseini.
“The two-state solution remains the only viable one we know.";"The “day after” the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza may still be weeks or months away. But it will come. “When this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next,” said US president Joe Biden recently. “And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution.”

Against a backdrop of repeated cycles of violence and a military occupation lasting more than half a century, diplomats and analysts agree that lasting peace must follow the bloodiest fighting between Israelis and Palestinians for decades.

The two-state solution to the bitter conflict that has beset the region for almost a century – dividing the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean to carve out two independent, sovereign Israeli and Palestinian states existing side by side – has repeatedly been endorsed by world leaders.

But it has proved impossible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach an agreement. And, since talks brokered by John Kerry, then the US secretary of state, collapsed in 2014, and as Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have proliferated, the consensus has been that the two-state solution is dead.

That view has been reinforced by opinion polls conducted shortly before Hamas’s deadly assault on Israeli citizens on 7 October. In September, a Pew Research Center survey found that only 35% of Israelis believed “a way can be found for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully” – a decline of 15 percentage points since 2013.

And a Gallup poll found that just 24% of Palestinians living in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem supported a two-state solution, down from 59% in 2012. Young Palestinians were significantly less enthusiastic than their parents.

Can the two-state solution be revived? And, given the continuing war, regional tensions and settlers’ presence in what would be a Palestinian state, what might it look like?

“There are no other viable alternatives,” said Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow at the Chatham House thinktank. “The two-state solution is the least bad option to enable both Israelis and Palestinians to fulfil their political, civil and human rights.”

What is lacking on both sides is leadership and political will. Both sides need to wake up after this horrible war Yossi Mekelberg, analyst

Yossi Beilin, a former Israeli peace negotiator, said: “It is the only solution – there is no realistic competition.”

But according to Aaron David Miller, an adviser on the Middle East to both Democratic and Republican administrations, “we have to distinguish between aspiration and reality”. He also warned: “The odds are very, very low. It’s essentially mission impossible.”

There are numerous obstacles in the way of a two-state solution, said Miller, not least that, in the immediate aftermath of the war, “we will be left with two deeply traumatised societies”.

Israel’s far-right government is viscerally opposed to the very idea of an independent Palestinian state, and its leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, has blocked progress on the issue for many years. Few expect him to survive as prime minister once the war is over, but there is no obvious pro-peace alternative in waiting.

The Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, who has been largely absent from the stage in the past month, is ineffectual and lacks credibility among the public. Abbas is 87, and his four-year term as president has so far lasted nearly 19 years.

His only plausible successor, Marwan Barghouti, a senior leader of the Fatah political faction and a hero to many Palestinians, has been in an Israeli prison for 21 years, serving five life sentences for murder.

“What is lacking on both sides is leadership and political will. Both sides need to wake up after this horrible war and find new leadership,” said Mekelberg.

In the US, traditionally the driver of the Middle East peace process, Biden’s energies will inevitably be absorbed in fighting to retain his presidency over the next 12 months. If he loses to Donald Trump, the chances of reviving the two-state solution are close to nil.

Arab states, which would be crucial players in any process, may be restrained by fury among their populations at huge numbers of civilian deaths and a desperate humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

And even if Israel, the Palestinians, the US and Arab countries were determined to push ahead with a new peace process, the key challenges of any deal – borders and Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the future of Jerusalem, the “right of return” of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, security and Gaza – are still on the table.

Yet the broad principles of an agreement have been accepted for many years, said Hiba Husseini, a Palestinian lawyer based in Ramallah. “We know what a two-state solution looks like.”

She and Beilin have produced a proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian confederation – a “cohabitation of two sovereign states” – to address a number of the details.

Some Jewish settlements close to the pre-1967 “green line” – the armistice agreement line drawn in 1949 at the end of the Arab-Israeli war, and that followed Israel’s declaration of a state in 1948 – would be incorporated into Israel, with compensatory land swaps for a new Palestinian state; a principle broadly accepted by all parties.

Under the confederation plan, Israelis living in settlements deeper in the West Bank would be able to choose whether to relocate to homes inside Israel or stay where they are as Israeli citizens who are permanent residents of Palestine, agreeing to abide by the new state’s laws. A comparable number of Palestinian citizens would be able to move to Israel on the same terms.

The Old City of Jerusalem, home to important Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, would become an “open city”, jointly administered by both nations. The open city would later be extended to encompass all Jewish and Muslim neighbourhoods of Jerusalem.

Gaza “cannot be left out” of a future Palestinian state, said Husseini. There will need to be land corridors between the West Bank and Gaza to allow access, but “there are already blueprints for those”.

Under those existing blueprints, a Palestinian state would have a police force but not an army or air force; and a symbolic number of descendants of Palestinian refugees would be permitted to return to live in Israel.

Public support

The principle of two states living side by side is “not only possible but critical”, said Husseini. “Before this war, there was a policy of ‘managing’ the conflict. It is now clear that it was a failed policy.”

Meanwhile, the one-state solution has gained traction, particularly among Palestinians and their supporters, in the absence of any moves towards a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state.

The idea is essentially for one democratic state to exist on the land that is now Israel and the Palestinian territories, with equal votes for all. But it would inevitably mean the end of the Jewish state, as Jews became a minority within the single state’s population.

The numbers are already unequal. According to the Israeli bureau of statistics last year, Jews were 74% of the Israeli population, at 7 million people. The Arab population of Israel was 21%, or almost 2 million people. This year, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics put the population of the West Bank and Gaza at almost 5.5 million people. When added to the 2 million Palestinians living in Israel, the total is nearly 7.5 million – more than Israel’s Jewish population. And the Palestinian population is significantly younger and therefore growing faster.

One state is unrealistic, said Yehuda Shaul, co-founder of Ofek, an independent Israeli thinktank dedicated to advancing a two-state solution. “Can you see a reality in which Israeli Jews give up their demographic hegemony within the green line, and decide to share the land and become a minority?”

But, he added: “Do I believe that two states are around the corner? No. Do I believe that the national project of the state of Israel is to prevent a two-state outcome? Yes.”

Peace will not come by itself; it has to be built. The two-state solution remains the only viable one we know Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chief

The Palestinian public would soon re-embrace a two-state solution, said Husseini. “Opinion on the street responds to what is happening. The mood reflects the moment, and now the moment is very dark. But if we have a horizon where we can see an endgame, the mood will change.”

The EU has said it is “ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution”. It has called for a peace conference to be held within six months of the end of the war.

“Peace will not come by itself; it has to be built,” said Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. “The two-state solution remains the only viable one we know. And if we only have one solution, we must put all our political energy into achieving it.”

Most observers agree that fresh and courageous political leadership on both sides is needed. “Both sides will have to undergo reckonings,” said Miller. “What’s needed is a [Nelson] Mandela and a [FW] de Klerk, or somebody close. Leaders may yet emerge – look at [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy.”

According to Beilin, with leadership and political will, a framework agreement could be reached relatively quickly: “Not weeks, but a year is possible,” he said. Public support would follow.

He added: “In the runup to Oslo [the historic 1993 peace accords], there was total opposition to any contact with the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organisation]. Once the agreement was signed, there was huge support.

“And I believe that, if an agreement could be reached after this war, there will also be big support.”"

In a similar vein, and after a month of war, Netanyahu’s intention is to destroy Hamas.
This will be followed by long-term control of Gaza, not just fencing it off.
The war in Gaza is a microcosm of a global reliance on military responses to what are, at root, not military problems but problems that often relate to questions of justice, political representation and economic development.
Furthermore, Gaza and the Ukraine war have meant a veritable bonanza for the global arms industry, with military spending going through the roof.";"At the start of the second month of the Gaza war, two questions emerge: what kind of conflict are we witnessing and how long will it last? These questions force us to consider longer trends in modern warfare, linked not just to the post-9/11 “wars on terror” but to a more global security paradigm that is about maintaining control, rather than addressing the underlying causes of revolt.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s 7 October assault, Benjamin Netanyahu talked of crushing the organisation so that it could never again threaten Israel. It was eerily similar to George W Bush’s declaration against al-Qaida and the Taliban after 9/11, which had dire consequences, especially for Afghanistan and Iraq.

In a similar vein, and after a month of war, Netanyahu’s intention is to destroy Hamas. This will be followed by long-term control of Gaza, not just fencing it off. As Netanyahu put it: “Israel will for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we do not have it.” Given the increasing pressure from West Bank settlers and the rise in violence, a high level of policing and military patrols will be essential there as well.

Even if Hamas can be destroyed in Gaza, which is already looking problematic – if, indeed, it is even possible – the ideas and aspirations behind it will remain, no doubt bolstered by many tens of thousands of younger people experiencing the full impact of this war.

We need to remember the specific and shocking circumstances that brought us to this point. More than 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed in the violent attacks of 7 October. That was nothing short of catastrophic but was also a terrible loss of control – Israel’s worst civilian loss for 75 years.

This struck at the heart of a state that has perhaps unknowingly lived the paradox of being impregnable in its insecurity. Jews in Israel simply had to feel secure, a need going right back to the experience of the Holocaust and even earlier. They created a very well-armed Israel but one that was opposed by the displaced Palestinians and many millions of people in the surrounding states.

Since 7 October, more than 10,000 Palestinians have already been reported killed in this quest for security, including more than 4,000 children. Large parts of Gaza City have been reduced to rubble, and Israeli control of energy, food and water supplies across the whole Gaza Strip is adding hugely to the suffering.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) is now engaged in the slow process of trying to fight the Hamas paramilitaries on their own territory. It is already taking many casualties, with the IDF’s specialist casualty evacuation group, Unit 669, airlifting about 260 wounded soldiers to Israel in the first few days, well before the main fighting in the dense urban areas fully unfolds.

Recent experience – Russia in Mariupol, western troops in Mosul (2016), Raqqa (2017) and Falluja (2004) – shows that in modern urban warfare the intense use of airpower and bombardment with huge loss of life is all too common. This is now unfolding in Gaza, but, with international criticism rising, time is not on Israel’s side.

How did we get here? Until last month, Israel had ensured its security by heavy use of military and paramilitary forces, persistent control of populations and high levels of surveillance, together with well-resourced intelligence and security agencies. It is a paradigm of control that can be termed “liddism”, keeping the lid on a problem rather than turning down the heat – and it has global significance with potentially disastrous consequences.

Wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere have repeatedly shown the difficulties of using intense force against paramilitaries. Now look at the consequences of those wars, which independent monitoring groups such as Iraq Body Count, Airwars and Brown University’s Costs of War centre have helped make public. So far, these post-9/11 wars have killed more than 900,000 people through direct violence and a further 3.5 million indirectly, with 38 million people displaced.

None has produced, or seems likely to produce, a lasting peace. Conflict continues in Iraq and Syria, including US airstrikes, while Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked militias are active right across the Sahel region and through to Somalia, with other states such as Uganda, Kenya, the DRC and even Mozambique affected.

The war in Gaza is a microcosm of a global reliance on military responses to what are, at root, not military problems but problems that often relate to questions of justice, political representation and economic development. Furthermore, Gaza and the Ukraine war have meant a veritable bonanza for the global arms industry, with military spending going through the roof.

The best realistically possible case for Gaza just now is that Netanyahu will have to eventually agree a ceasefire, and sufficient international pressure will open the possibility of a settlement. Beyond that, there still lies the much greater task of rethinking what is even meant by international security if a perpetually unstable world is to be avoided. Liddism won’t work in Gaza and will not work in the wider world.

Fifty years ago, the economic geographer Edwin Brooks warned of the risk of the world becoming a “crowded glowering plant of massive inequalities of wealth buttressed by stark force yet endlessly threatened by desperate men in the global ghettoes”. That looks decidedly prophetic now. But if an alternative definition of prophecy is “suggesting the possible”, then such an approach is very badly needed now, along with a serious debate about what is meant by “security”.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israeli forces had pushed through the outskirts of Gaza City. “We’re at the height of the battle,” he said.

At least 9,061 people have been killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October, including 3,760 children, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Thursday. The current conflict began on 7 October when Hamas launched an onslaught on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and swept up hundreds more as hostages. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify figures from either Israeli or Palestinian authorities.

In the US, the Republican-led lower chamber of Congress has passed a $14bn aid package for Israel, defying President Joe Biden’s request to also include more money for Ukraine and other pressing priorities. The bill, which diverts funding budgeted to the US tax collection agency, is almost certain to fail in the Democratic-controlled Senate, while Biden has also threatened to veto it.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken will urge the Israeli government to agree to a series of “humanitarian pauses” to the fighting in Gaza, according to a report.Blinken said on Thursday he would seek “concrete steps” from Israel to “minimise harm” to civilians in Gaza. He is due to spend the day on Friday in Israel, his fourth visit since 7 October, before other engagements in the region. Blinken, is expected back in the region on Friday.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said four of its schools in Gaza that are being used as shelters have been damaged in less than 24 hours. At least 20 people have reportedly been killed and five others injured on Thursday after a school that is being used as a shelter was damaged at the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, the agency said in its latest update. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said at least 27 people were killed in a blast near a UN school in the Jabalia camp on Thursday.

At least 15 people have been killed after a blast in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on Thursday, the health ministry said. A spokesperson for Gaza’s civil defence said the blast took place in a residential building, and residents reported scores of people trapped beneath the rubble.

Eighteen Israeli soldiers have been killed amid fierce fighting in Gaza, the IDF said, in a series of incidents that have underlined the mounting challenges facing the IDF in their attempts to push further into built-up areas of Gaza. The dead include Lt Col Salman Habaka, an Israeli tank commander who was hailed a hero for his actions during Hamas’s attack on Be’eri kibbutz.

A journalist working for the Palestinian Authority’s television channel was killed in an Israeli strike on Gaza, his network reported. Mohammed Abu Hatab was killed along with 11 members of his family in their home, the authority’s official news agency WAFA reported. He is the 36th journalist killed in the conflict, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group, said it had attacked 19 positions in Israel on Thursday evening. The strikes came hours after Hezbollah said it had used two drones packed with explosives to attack an Israeli army command position in the disputed Shebaa Farms area on the Lebanese-Israeli border earlier in the day. It is the first time Hezbollah has acknowledged carrying out an attack against Israeli forces using such dronese.

The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened for a second day to allow the evacuation of some injured Palestinians and foreign passport holders. British nationals were able to get out of Gaza on Thursday, the UK Foreign Office confirmed. The US has been able to get 74 dual citizens out of Gaza, Joe Biden said. A total of 400 foreign passport holders as well as 60 severely wounded Palestinians were due to cross by the end of Thursday, a spokesperson for the Palestinian side of the crossing said.

A Japanese military plane departed Israel late on Thursday carrying 46 passengers including 20 Japanese nationals, the Japanese foreign ministry said. Passengers aboard also included 15 South Koreans, four Vietnamese and one Taiwanese, the ministry said on Friday.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was “almost impossible” to bring humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The WHO’s emergencies director, Michael Ryan, said the basic safety of staff could not be guaranteed at the moment. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation in Gaza was “indescribable”.

A group of United Nations experts have called for a ceasefire in Gaza, warning that “time is running out” as Palestinian people there find themselves at “grave risk of genocide”. In a statement, they expressed “deep frustration with Israel’s refusal to halt plans to decimate” the Gaza Strip and said they felt “deepening horror” about Israeli airstrikes against the Jabalia refugee camp."

In this clash, the battle lines are drawn in a very different place, and the alliances and enmities take unexpected shapes. We got a glimpse of it this week – and when the current violence subsides, we shall see it even more starkly.

Right now, that moment – what diplomats and others refer to as “the day after” – seems a long way off, though the visit to Israel on Friday of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, suggests that Washington is already looking at its watch: proof that even some of Israel’s staunchest allies are alarmed by the mounting loss of life in Gaza. Blinken is urging Israel to do more to protect civilians; others demand a ceasefire, or at least a pause. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under pressure. But this week, as he sought to make Israel’s case, he received help from an unexpected quarter.

Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Lebanese TV that his organisation was determined to repeat the massacre of 7 October, when the men of Hamas murdered some 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, torturing and maiming their victims in ways too cruel to recount. Hamad promised that 7 October was “just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth”. He was asked if Hamas was bent on Israel’s annihilation. “Yes, of course,” he replied.

It was as clear an answer as Israel could have hoped for as it seeks to explain why it cannot lay down its arms until Hamas is rendered incapable of doing again what it did four weeks ago, arguing that Israel should be granted as much leeway as the US (and UK) granted themselves when they set about the destruction of Isis.

The result has been an Israeli onslaught that has already taken some 9,000 Gazan lives, destroying entire families at a stroke. Though in explaining that appallingly high figure, here too Hamas offered some assistance. One Hamas official was asked by a TV interviewer if the organisation’s more than 300-mile network of underground tunnels could not perhaps shelter civilians. No, no, the Hamas man explained: “The tunnels are for us [Hamas]. The citizens in the Gaza Strip are under the responsibility of the United Nations.”

Perhaps the Hamas men felt they had a favour to return to Netanyahu. After all, he had done them more than one good turn, notoriously telling a 2019 meeting of his own Likud party – in words reported and never denied – “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas … This is part of our strategy.”

All of which goes to the poisonous, often-overlooked dynamic that has been present in the Israel-Palestine conflict for decades, and which will matter again when the current chapter ends. For then we’ll see that the contest that matters most is the battle of hardliners v moderates, or, to be more specific, maximalists v partitionists: those who insist on having the whole land for themselves v those who are ready to share it. Here’s how it could play out.

At present, there appears to be no Israeli plan, beyond the immediate objective of destroying Hamas as a military force. That will destroy Hamas as a governing power, too, not only leaving Gaza in ruins and rubble, but also creating a vacuum. There’s talk in some quarters of creating a “neo-trusteeship”, in which other nations step in to create order before a new arrangement is established: advocates cite Kosovo and East Timor as precedents.

The powers entrusted with that task could not be western, obviously, but perhaps a coalition of Arab states with Gulf money. Those countries may well say no anyway, but they will be certain to refuse unless the trusteeship is an interim step towards Palestinian self-rule. In testimony to Congress this week, Blinken hinted pretty heavily that, with Hamas out of the picture, the right body for that task would be the Palestinian Authority currently in place in the West Bank and dominated by Hamas’s rivals, Fatah – who remain partitionists rather than maximalists.

There is no way that the authority would even countenance such a plan unless it was a transition to genuine Palestinian statehood. But that would require a radical strategic shift by Israel, starting with a change of government and prime minister.

The latter is increasingly plausible. Netanyahu has provoked widespread revulsion in Israel with his refusal to attend even one funeral for the dead of 7 October or to take responsibility for the security failures of that day. The same goes for his tweeted – and then deleted – attempt to shift the blame on to his military advisers, reportedly at the prompting of his wife and son Yair, the Miami dauphin who has remained in Florida rather than return home to enlist with his fellow army reservists.

But removing Netanyahu will be the least of it. For Israel to pursue the two-state solution, which Netanyahu has spent nearly three decades working to render impossible, will require an end to the settlement project in the West Bank and the concession of territory. It will be an argument between those who believe the land has to be divided between the two peoples, and those who want all of it.

In a way, it will come down to a referendum over the meaning of 7 October and, indeed, of the last decade and a half. The partitionists will say that 7 October proves that the approach of recent years – leaving Hamas in place and allowing it to build up a fearsome arsenal; weakening the moderates of the authority by closing off a return to negotiations; expanding settlements and entrenching the occupation of the West Bank – has clearly failed to protect Israelis. The maximalists will say that it was Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 – pulling out every soldier and settler – that allowed Hamas to flourish and led to mass slaughter.

In this contest, the moderates will be depicted as fatally naive. After all, it was kibbutz peaceniks and longtime believers in Arab-Jewish dialogue who were disproportionately represented among those killed and taken hostage last month. In this task, of making the moderates look ridiculous, Israel’s extremists will have an unlikely ally – the same ally they’ve always had: the extremists on the other side.

Which is why that Hamas TV interview, promising more bloodcurdling massacres, was so on-brand. This is what Hamas do every time the prospect of an accommodation comes into view. They did it in the mid-1990s, in the era of the Oslo accords, blowing up buses in order to turn Israelis against Yitzhak Rabin, at the very moment a peace agreement seemed possible. They did it again during the election campaign that followed, thereby helping Netanyahu win his first term in office in 1996. And they did it last month, as they saw Saudi Arabia and Israel inch towards a normalisation of relations. Yes, some in Hamas say they want political negotiations, but past experience suggests if there’s a chance of an agreement that entails any outcome other than the annihilation of Israel, then the maximalists of Hamas will veto it with violence.

Israel has its own saboteurs, its own maximalists. Several of them are inside Netanyahu’s ultra-right government, ministers sharing their macabre fantasies of a flattened Gaza on social media, the likes of Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, men apparently determined to deepen the current violence by ensuring it spreads to the West Bank and inside Israel itself.

This, then, is the battle to come. The only long-term solution is two states side by side. The only short-term solution for Gaza is a plan that promises Palestinian statehood. Every step of the way, the men on both sides who want the whole land for themselves will be on hand to derail progress – and, though sworn enemies, they will aid each other in that shared mission. It is a gruesome waltz they do together, this dance of death. Those on both sides who believe in compromise will not be able to fight them alone. They will need allies – including those taking to the streets who call themselves progressives – and the help of a world that finally decides it has seen too much bloodshed and cannot bear to see any more."

Her sister is a social worker in a mainly Muslim team, whereas Paula works for a company involved in Israel’s Iron Dome and has Jewish friends.
She describes her mother as Catholic and father as an atheist Jew from east London, while her husband is a Muslim Palestinian from east Jerusalem with family in the West Bank.
“I have a lot of non-Jewish friends, and some of them are close friends, and they avoid the topic completely.
I think they see Israeli children, they see Palestinian children, and it doesn’t matter whose children they are.”Yet there are costs.";"Amid the noise and the fury surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, some places are unexpectedly quiet.

“I’ve got friends, dear friends of 30 years standing,” said Charlie. They are scattered across the world, and stay in touch online, through platforms including WhatsApp.

“We’ve got one friend who is going off. And the rest of us are just standing back. It’s literal silence on a group that’s normally very, very prepared to dive in on issues.”

Charlie is a pseudonym, because this silence is the manifestation of fear. “You think, if I say something then you go down the worst kind of rabbit hole,” they said. “It’s so hard, because it seems a greater crime, what’s happening in Gaza. Yet what Hamas did and have promised they will continue to do is appalling. I think everyone is trying to find a safe place to land and so a lot of people are not saying anything.”

Charlie’s parents came to England from Ireland. “It all makes me think of what I faced as a child during the Troubles.” They were viewed as West Brits to Irish relatives, and hid their Irishness at school. “My grandmother came over and I remember so vividly her and my dad having an absolute screaming match about the bombings in England. It was so unusual for them.”

Those kinds of divisions, among friends, family and colleagues, are being played out across the UK, a month after the Hamas attacks on 7 October, often with the help of private social media channels set up to talk about football or music or other parents. For every group like Charlie’s, where someone rails against Israel, the response from western governments and anti-Muslim incidents, there are others where people vent their anger at terrorists, people marching on Armistice Day and antisemitism.

For the silent, words are suppressed by the fear that using the wrong language will mean they are labelled as antisemitic or Islamophobic by people who assume that anyone opposing them must be acting in bad faith.

“If someone sees people saying what seem to be reasonable things, and witnesses reactions to them which are so powerful and so overwhelming, I completely understand people just want to shut up and sit there quietly till it blows over,” said Jeremy Ginges, a professor in behavioural science at the London School of Economics.

The alternative is to risk rejection, which can be psychologically devastating, yet silence is also challenging.

“What is happening in the Jewish left, especially the Israeli Jewish left, is that after the Hamas attacks they felt almost rejected by the mainstream left, who didn’t recognise their level of suffering,” he said.

“I’m talking mainly from a Jewish perspective, but I also have a lot of Arab and Muslim friends and colleagues, including Palestinians, and it’s worked exactly the same way for them feeling rejected from their professional communities somehow, because they’ve been silenced.

“We know that rejection is such a powerful motivator, and ostracism has such far-reaching psychological and behavioural consequences and negative consequences for relationships. The most important goal is I think to try and prevent those eruptions from occurring, and find ways to mediate these disagreements and stop them from from getting worse.”

Dr Blerina Këllezi, associate professor in social and trauma psychology at Nottingham Trent University, identified five key factors in how people manage conflicts with people close to them. How central is the issue to someone’s identity? What else is happening in their relationship? What is the perceived impact on their future? How are other people reacting? And are they trying to engage in dialogue?

“Families are key because you need people you trust when you discuss such critical and sensitive topics,” she said. “But the moment families are involved in disagreements, that’s when all the negative emotions can follow.”

Paula – another pseudonym – has always been close to her sister but finds herself now avoiding discussing the Israel-Hamas war. Her sister is a social worker in a mainly Muslim team, whereas Paula works for a company involved in Israel’s Iron Dome and has Jewish friends. Even though she objects to the bombing of Gaza, her sister’s views seem “strange”, she said.

“I feel I have to keep certain topics off the table, and I’ve never had that with her. I love my sister very, very much and we’ve always been very close. So I don’t want to fall out with her over something like this.”

Sophia is the name chosen by doctor at a hospital in northern England. She describes her mother as Catholic and father as an atheist Jew from east London, while her husband is a Muslim Palestinian from east Jerusalem with family in the West Bank. She is strongly pro-Palestinian, and has posted online about the ways she feels her husband is discriminated against in Israel as a Palestinian.

Bringing home her Palestinian boyfriend years ago made her father interrogate his own sense of Jewishness, she said, something he had generally ignored, along with the assumption, inherited from his mother, that “Israel was for the Jews”. Now father and daughter have similar views, but it is harder for her at work, where colleagues include doctors who are Israeli and Palestinian, and her fears for a colleague in Gaza whose house was bombed. “At the start of the conflict he had a little baby and I haven’t heard from them for a few days but if he’s still alive he might be three months old now. So it’s very personal and it’s very painful.”

For those who have already lost someone to the violence, cutting ties can be a form of self-preservation. Jeremy Freeman’s mother’s cousin was murdered in front of her young children during the Hamas attacks, and the content writer from Hertfordshire felt he was forced to cut ties with a client.

“We had a fantastic relationship, we used to laugh, we talked a lot, she was a good client,” he said. “But she kept putting up images – posting messages that I felt were borderline antisemitic. She didn’t mention the massacre by Hamas – it was very one-sided. No condemnation. It’s Hamas I object to, not the idea of Palestine as part of a two-state solution.”

They had a conversation, but Freeman felt too uncomfortable to work with her. “I’m by no means poor, but losing that money will do damage to me because I’m self-employed. So I didn’t take it lightly.”

Some of his relationships have become stronger – people have been supportive on social media – but Freeman said he was now scared and volunteers to help with security at his son’s Jewish school. For him, silence can feel like rejection.

“I have a lot of non-Jewish friends, and some of them are close friends, and they avoid the topic completely. Whether it’s because they feel they’re not educated, or uncomfortable about it I don’t know. But I wish they would reach out.”

Gilda Levy set up the Women’s Interfaith Network with her friend Pinky Lilani after the September 11 attacks, giving women of all faiths an opportunity to meet people from other communities.

“It’s become more important than ever because of the divisions that you can see every day,” Lady Levy said. “And the way communities are pulling apart from each other, which is horrendous, absolutely horrendous.” Some members have experienced anti-Muslim and antisemitic behaviour, but not from within the interfaith groups, she said. “I’ve only heard positive stuff from Muslim and Jewish members. I think they see Israeli children, they see Palestinian children, and it doesn’t matter whose children they are.”

Yet there are costs. “There are some people in my community I can’t talk to now,” she said. “I’m not on the same page as they are. So many people have said to me, not now but in the past, ‘interfaith is a complete waste of time – they don’t like us, they hate us’. It’s a very, very difficult time. If you want to keep any semblance of humanity, it’s a very difficult time.

Grandparents, aunts and uncles become like second parents to children. Cousins become like siblings. Family members care for each other’s kids, changing diapers, feeding them, making sure they get to and from school. In moments of crisis and uncertainty, they evacuate together, worry together, grieve together.

For the 33rd day, Israeli bombs and missiles have rained down on the besieged Gaza Strip, after the 7 October attack by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed 1,400 Israelis and took more than 240 people hostage or prisoner. The death toll in Gaza reached more than 10,000 people on Monday, according to the Palestinian ministry of health. Israel’s government says it will not consider a ceasefire unless the hostages are freed as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens by the hour.

By the 31st day of Israeli airstrikes, a ministry of health spokesperson said that 1,200 Palestinian families had their homes destroyed, and that dozens of families were removed from Gaza’s population registry altogether. But in some families, a member or two does survive, who must learn to go on alone after painful and sudden loss. The Guardian spoke to some of these last survivors during the third week of the war.

‘I found myself covered in others’ blood’

Rushdiyya Toutah is a 43-year-old wheelchair user from Gaza City, in the north of Gaza. On 17 October, she sat in the yard at the al-Ahli Arab hospital, surrounded by other displaced people who sought refuge there. An hour later, a blast killed nearly 500 of them, according to Palestinian officials. (Israeli and US intelligence officials say the death count was much lower.) That included every adult member of Toutah’s family. Once she learned the fate of her loved ones, she could only cry out: “Why, why I am here? I need to go with them. We were always together, why didn’t we die together?”

Earlier in the day, Toutah said her eldest brother alerted the family to airstrikes near their home and insisted they all evacuate to a safer place. Toutah and one of her sisters are mobility-impaired, which meant it would have been nearly impossible for them to hurry out of their home in time to escape an impending strike. And in the event of a surprise attack, they would not have been able to pull themselves out of the rubble.

So the whole family, nearly 40 members in all, headed towards the hospital. “We felt safe,” Toutah said. “There were thousands of people and kids.” Her brothers set up tents for everyone in the yard, and they settled in as they listened to Israeli warplanes fly overhead.

Then, horror struck: “All I remember is that the kids said that they were hungry, so their mothers started making sandwiches for them after asking them to go to play in the yard,” Toutah said. “I saw them laughing and playing while their mothers were happy, preparing the food. Then I found myself covered in others’ blood in al-Shifa hospital, where the rescuer and the paramedics took me.”

Toutah’s parents, her two brothers, their wives and her disabled sister were all killed. Of the children in her family, only a nephew, Yamen, survived. Toutah somehow made it through, although with significant injuries: “I felt pain in all my body parts, and I could barely even see, as my eyes were hurting.” She says they were exposed to intense flames. Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike caused the explosion, while US intelligence agencies and Israel claim the strike was the result of a malfunctioning missile launched from within Gaza.

Toutah has another sister who is married and living elsewhere in Gaza City. Because al-Shifa hospital was overrun with the injured and quickly running out of supplies, her sister wanted Toutah to leave with her. Toutah hesitated.

“It was a difficult and risky choice. I asked: ‘What if they bomb us again?’ But my sister insisted: ‘We have no choice but to face our destiny,’” she said. “I am now trapped in the home of my sister, where the house is shaking every single moment there is a massive explosion. Now, my sister is taking care of me along with my little nephew, Yamen, who is also a sole survivor.”

‘I am crumbled now. No dreams, no plans’

Eighteen-year-old Dima al-Lamdani dreamed of being a successful businesswoman while growing up in the Shati refugee camp. When Israel’s military warned on 13 October that everyone in the north of Gaza should evacuate south, Lamdani’s father called his brother, and all of them, several generations of an extended family, decided to flee the camp. They took temporary refuge in the home of a family friend, carrying enough fuel with them to fill generators to charge their phones and LED lights.

Two days later at dawn, Lamdani sat with her aunt drinking coffee, unable to sleep. The next thing she remembers, she was covered in rubble with the sounds of people shouting all around her. Nearly 50 people were in the residential building, including 17 members of Lamdani’s family. Lamdani, her brother, and her two younger cousins, who were pulled from the rubble of the house, were the only survivors. “The time I spent waiting to be found were some of the most horrifying moments. I was about to lose my mind. I screamed and cried when they found me,” Lamdani said.

Lamdani was then brought to a mortuary where she had to identify the bodies of her loved ones. “I could hardly recognise them, as their facial features changed. I bawled and begged: ‘Please don’t leave me alone. I can’t live without you!’” she said. Just the week before, they had been making plans for her future. “I told them I will be a popular person and businesswoman and that they will all come to beg to work with me. I was joking to make them laugh.”

Lamdani’s two cousins are now in her care, and she wonders how she will go on. “I am crumbled now. No dreams, no hopes, no plans. I can’t imagine my life without my mother and sister and father,” she said. “The Israeli forces betrayed us. There is no place that is safe.”

‘How can she live without parents?’

Samah Aladini is grieving for her lost daughter, whose home in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza was hit without warning by an Israeli airstrike on 24 October. Nai’emah, her six-year-old granddaughter, survived the strike and is now in her grandmother’s care. “I remember my slain daughter. How can her little daughter live without parents?” Aladini said.

As Nai’emah sits in Aladini’s lap, she recalled how her mother was sleepy, but she knew Nai’emah loved fried potatoes so she cooked in spite of her fatigue. Her paternal grandmother was praying and her grandfather was listening to the news on the radio. The last thing Nai’emah remembered is that he called her and her siblings over to give them all something – a treat, maybe. The strike that followed killed Nai’emah’s parents, paternal grandparents and siblings.

“I still don’t know what my grandfather wanted to give us. I dreamed of him yesterday, that he gave me a doll, but the doll was scary and I ran away,” Nai’emah said.

But to even refer to a “peace process” these days is fallacious: there has not been a peace process for years, or even the prospect of one. That said, I believe it is possible that from the ashes of the present wretchedness, one could arise.

There were times, notably during the Oslo years, when a more peaceful future could be glimpsed. For decades, following my advocacy of a two-state solution in the early 1970s, I worked closely with Israelis and Palestinians and was often struck by the camaraderie between peace negotiators – rarely matched in other conflict situations – and at unofficial “track-two” meetings. It was not uncommon for them to socialise between sessions.

The flaws in the substance and implementation of the Oslo accords, the stealthy settler conquest of the West Bank and the advancing far-right takeover of the Israeli government put paid to all that. Israelis were told fairy tales by their leaders about “generous offers” that the Palestinians routinely spurned. In the quest for normalised relations with Arab states, Israel’s leaders treated the Palestinians as a defeated people and ignored the cautions of a bevy of analysts of a ferocious explosion if Israel persisted with its occupation of the land and lives of another people. They cannot say they were not warned.

But the stunning failure to anticipate Hamas’s murderous assault was more than a failure of intelligence. It was a failure of concept, born of an abiding contempt for the capabilities and resolve of the Arab foe. This is not the first time a cocktail of hubris and complacency has intoxicated Israel’s leaders. A few weeks before Israel was caught off guard by the Egyptian-Syrian military offensive in 1973, the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir, told me that if the Arabs were to start a war, she would “feel sorry for the Arabs”. Defence minister general Moshe Dayan prophesied a “six-hour war”. Political heads rolled then. They will surely roll again.

Hamas leaders, who unequivocally share responsibility for the death and destruction being delivered on the people of Gaza, cannot say they were not warned either. Their Lebanese ally, Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, proclaimed in 2006 that had he known it would spark more than a month of warfare at the cost of many lives, displacements and huge physical damage, he would not have ordered the killing and seizure of Israeli soldiers.

It is not clear that the mass killings and kidnappings of Israelis, the consequent slaughter of Palestinians and the reduction of Gaza to rubble had a higher purpose – with the possible exceptions of forestalling closer Saudi-Israel relations and the elevation of Hamas over the Palestinian Authority. On its part, deeply traumatised Israel is lashing out. But rage and vengeance are not a strategy either. They are reflexes that will just fuel the carnage. Neither side appears to know what it’s doing.

Tellingly, every peaceable advance since 1967 has been provoked by an unforeseen seismic event. The 1967 war itself goaded Palestinians into lowering their sights and accepting a state alongside Israel instead of in place of Israel. The 1973 war led to the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979. The first Palestinian intifada culminated in the 1993 Oslo accord. The second intifada impelled the 2002 Arab peace initiative. While it is too early to say with confidence, it is possible that the current outrage will track the same pattern.

If nothing else, the turmoil has surely shattered the illusion that the Palestinian issue can be sidelined, that the conflict can be ignored or managed, or that it can be resolved through military force or by acts of terrorism. These are not new truths, but they should now be as clear as day even to the most hardened ideologues. There is an imperative need, even as the bloodletting continues, for a comprehensive solution to be swiftly formulated, predicated on the satisfaction of the minimum core needs and aspirations of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the allaying of their maximum fears. These have always been the indispensable ingredients.

The US has proved itself to be singularly unsuited to play the role of honest broker but, with other external powers, it could put its weight behind an initiative spearheaded by regional states that have made their peace with Israel – exploiting a potential unintended benefit of the Abraham accords – plus Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. A revised Arab peace initiative – which in its original incarnation pledged to normalise relations with Israel in exchange for Palestinian statehood – could provide the blueprint. Despite everything, the conflict can still be resolved but, if the chance is not seized quickly and robustly, future seismic explosions – foreseen or unforeseen – lay in wait."

Khalidi is critical of Hamas, its indiscriminate attacks on Israeli civilians, and how it has undermined the Palestinian cause through its violence.
One wonders how much death it would take in Gaza for a Palestinian state to emerge alongside it.";"The war between Israel and Hamas did not start on 7 October. But when did it begin?

Two books that have shot to the top of national bestseller lists in recent weeks attempt to answer that question, through divergent histories of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Currently at No 3 on the New York Times nonfiction paperback bestseller list is the pre-eminent Palestinian American historian Rashid Khalidi’s The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017, which draws on scholarly research and the author’s experience to explain Palestinian dispossession and perseverance in the face of colonialism. At No 5 on the list is Israel: A Simple Guide to the Most Misunderstood Country on Earth by the actor and former Israeli envoy Noa Tishby, a breezy rundown of Israel’s national myths and talking points.

You could judge them by their covers: Khalidi’s blurbs are from the Financial Times, the Nation and Middle East academics, while Bill Maher, Aaron Sorkin, Ritchie Torres and Ben Shapiro line up behind Tishby. Though both books are a few years old, Americans are turning to them to understand how and why Hamas could launch attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped 242, according to that country’s defense forces, and how Israel could respond with an assault on Gaza that has already killed more than 10,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, amid a humanitarian catastrophe.

These books’ current popularity shows that Americans want to get into the history of this moment – but even in doing that, they are picking a side. Read together, however, they make clear the war about the war has been a century in the making.

Although the books were published two years ago this month, both authors have taken stages across the country. Khalidi spoke alongside Ta-Nehisi Coates at the packed Palestine Festival of Literature at Riverside Church in Harlem, and Tishby is posting social media videos about Israel between her TV hits. Both authors are keen to use their histories to shape how the world sees this conflict.

Both writers bring in personal and family histories to show readers how viscerally Palestinians and Israelis relate to a conflict both groups view as existential. Where the authors differ most is in how willing they are to engage with the other side’s perspective and narratives.

Khalidi hails from a Jerusalem family of scholars whose ancestral apartment is steps from the Dome of the Rock, one of the most contested pieces of real estate in the Holy Land. His great-great-great-uncle corresponded with Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Khalidi’s own history tracks with that of the Palestinian struggle, and he recounts working alongside the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) during the Lebanese civil war in the 1970s and early 1980s, and then fleeing with his young family as Beirut became unlivable under Israeli bombardment; the advisory role he played in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991; and his encounters with Palestinian luminaries from Ghassan Kanafani to Edward Said to Yasser Arafat.

Throughout, Khalidi engages in nuanced self-criticism, interviewing former diplomats to understand how Israel outmaneuvered the PLO in the 1990s, during the Oslo peace process that followed from Madrid, and how Arafat and the old guard had grown out of touch with a new generation of Palestinians in the occupied territories. He uses the framework of settler colonialism to explain the success of the Zionist movement in taking the land and emptying it of its inhabitants. He reads primary sources and documents conveying displacement, ethnic cleansing and apartheid policies, to demonstrate how Israel has prevented an independent Palestine through six historical periods that constitute a century-long war against Palestinians.

The pro-Israel crowd could benefit from this history to understand the roots of today’s war. Instead they are probably reading what Tishby herself calls a “history-ish book”. An Israeli producer and actor who made it in Hollywood, she worked as Israel’s special envoy for combating antisemitism and delegitimization. Her writing is strongest when describing the formative roles her grandparents played in the Zionist movement in Europe and in the early days of the state of Israel. Her book begins by cementing the Jewish people’s biblical and religious connections to “their tiny piece of ancestral land”, and then recounts in detail antisemitism in Europe.

In this book, Mandatory Palestine was “mostly empty” and the Arabs were always trying to “wipe the new Jewish state off the map”. She spends more space censuring the United Nations and its refugee aid work for Palestinians than in understanding how and why Israel displaced Palestinians.

It’s only toward the end of her book that Tishby’s goal becomes clear: this is a guide to countering Palestinian boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) activism and the swelling of anti-Zionist perspectives on US college campuses — all told in the voice of Carrie Bradshaw.

Indeed it’s the type of historical sweep that Khalidi provides – of Zionism as a colonial project, empowered first by the British and then by the US empires – that Tishby’s polemic is responding to. Where Tishby says that Palestinian claims of indigenousness don’t apply and that the Zionist project had nothing to do with colonialism, Khalidi returns to the words and deeds of Israel’s founders to situate a history of Palestinians that most Americans are not taught, and which until the recent war have been largely absent from US media.

Noa Tishby says her awakening came during the 2010 Gaza flotilla, when activists set sail from Turkey to break the siege on Gaza with humanitarian items, and Israeli forces boarded the boats and killed nine people. At that time, the Israeli government had yet to grasp the power of decentralized social media and the fact of shifting global perceptions of its occupation. “Israel’s PR problems were about to turn into an existential threat,” she writes. Soon she was briefing the Israeli military on digital strategy and became an unofficial ambassador.

This is a guide to countering BDS activism and the swelling of anti-Zionist perspectives on US college campuses – all told in the voice of Carrie Bradshaw

She assures readers that she is a liberal, centrist/lefty and feminist, but in her casual millennial tone she reaches for tired caricatures of Palestinians and Arabs that are dismissive if not mildly racist. Tishby repeats without context Golda Meir’s infamous denial of Palestinians’ existence, and notes: “There has never been a coherent Palestinian national, religious, or political identity.” The occupied West Bank city of Hebron “felt like a hostile Arab country” to her as a young soldier hanging out there with Ayelet Shaked before she became a rightwing minister.

Tishby repeats that Israel is not a perfect country – but sees Israel as an inclusive democracy for all, whose faults are not systemic or by design but that simply get too much international scrutiny. For many audiences, especially those who didn’t receive these pro-Israel messages through Hebrew school or on a Birthright trip, it’s useful to see the Hasbara handbook updated for the 21st century, and the maps, bullet points and highly abridged timelines show how Israel sees itself in the world.

Khalidi understands this too, and notes that Israel’s reputation abroad is “in some ways its most vital asset”. He often returns to the PR problem of Palestinians, specifically that Arafat and the PLO didn’t understand the significance of US public opinion to their cause and thus failed to mobilize it.

But Tishby’s narrative can’t engage with actual Palestinians because it would undermine her entire perspective. SodaStream, previously an Israeli company located in the West Bank, with its Palestinian workers, represents peace. The occupied West Bank is “restrictive AF” for Palestinians, but also “in limbo”, and “there is enough blame to go around”. Israel is, as she puts it, “the worst apartheid state ever”, because Palestinian citizens of Israel, she says, have equal rights. She celebrates Jewish refugeedom, but her “intrepid curiosity” is not extended to Palestinians, whose identity and history she often dismisses, and whom she rarely speaks with.

Most offensive is how she describes 1948, the catastrophe Palestinians call the Nakba. She emphasizes the Nakba’s “sudden rebranding” that gained currency a couple of decades ago when the PLO inaugurated it as an annual occasion in 1998. She relies on passive voice to convey the official Israeli mythic version of Israel’s war of independence: “blood was spilled, and atrocities were committed” and Arabs “got pushed out”.

Khalidi, for his part, goes into great depth on the “violent transformation” of that year, notably the ethnic cleansing and land theft that would shape Israel’s establishment. He details the “post-Nakba political vacuum” of Arab disunity and complex intra-Palestinian politics, which Tishby tends to dismiss as a hot mess and indicative of the absence of a real Palestinian identity or a claim on the land.

Both of these books were published before Hamas’s October attacks, yet they tell a crucial story about the players shaping the Middle East’s future. These are the two dominant narratives but they are not symmetrical: the Palestinian scholar examining how US policy has enabled Israel for 75 years, and an Israeli celebrity wondering why everyone seems to hate this little country, and believing that better messaging could help.

But what do these two books say about Gaza, and how this war will end?

Khalidi is critical of Hamas, its indiscriminate attacks on Israeli civilians, and how it has undermined the Palestinian cause through its violence. He also traces Israel’s military doctrine of disproportionate force and the tremendous amount of US weapons given to Israel. What is most helpful for readers is his explanation of relevant moments that aren’t directly about Gaza but explain where this war might go, like the PLO’s transformation from a militant group to Israel’s negotiating partner. His intimate experience of surviving Israel’s onslaught of Beirut in 1982 is an eerie parallel to the accounts coming out of Gaza today.

Tishby’s descriptions of Gaza are mainly focused on Hamas’s determination to implement “sharia law” there and on the rockets it has sent into Israel. She chastises college students for protesting against Israel but not Hamas. Maybe Tishby should read Khalidi to understand where Hamas came from – the generations of Palestinian leaders who were assassinated, the missteps of Arab states and the harshness of Israeli occupation.

For Tishby, the Palestinians have rejected Israel’s peace entreaties at every turn. Khalidi says that the previous process toward a two-state solution was always rigged in Israel’s favor and, while questioning the PLO’s approach, concludes that an “unending series of unilateral Israeli actions”, backed with US power, turned the Palestinian Authority into a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation rather than a liberation movement.

Tishby writes “It would take a Holocaust” for the Jewish state to emerge. One wonders how much death it would take in Gaza for a Palestinian state to emerge alongside it."

They are moving because they understand that Hamas has lost control in the north,” Daniel Hagari said in a Wednesday briefing.

Israel has claimed to have destroyed 130 Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip since it began its ground operations. In videos posted to social media by Hagari, it showed what it said was evidence of the destruction.

Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed dozens of Hamas commanders as troops advance deeper into the battered territory, with some fighting in “the heart of Gaza City”, IDF officials and analysts have said. However, there were doubts over the importance of the dead commanders within Hamas, and analysts said there was no obvious sign that the organisation had yet been significantly weakened.

Jonathan Conricus, who is acting as a spokesperson for the Israeli military during the conflict, has described the Hamas leadership inside and outside of Gaza as “dead men walking”. He said “The directive is definitely to kill or capture … all the leaders of Hamas. Those who planned, facilitated, and executed the murderous 7 October massacre in Israel. We’ve said so clearly. All of them are dead men walking. And it’s only a matter of time inside Gaza and outside of Gaza, until these Hamas leaders will either be captured or killed by Israel.”

Israel has claimed to kill the senior weapon maker of Hamas, Mohsen Abu Zina. The IDF described him as “an expert in developing strategic weapons and rockets used by Hamas terrorists”.

Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesperson, told Sky News in the UK on Wednesday that only 100,000 civilians remained in northern Gaza out of the population of 1.1 million.

The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip has said that the number of people killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions since the start of the war on 7 October has risen to 10,569. It says 4,324 of these are children, and that a further 26,457 Palestinians have been injured.

Under white flags and carrying a few possessions, thousands of Palestinian civilians attempted to make the perilous journey to the south of Gaza under the watch of Israeli tanks as the sounds of war rang out in the near distance. On Wednesday the scale of the movement prompted the IDF to extend the period of the “safe corridor” by an extra hour “in reaction to [Palestinians] sizeable response” to Israel’s call for them to use the corridor to flee.

The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, has said both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes. Speaking during a visit to the Rafah crossing and El Arish hospital in Egypt on Wednesday, Türk described the border crossing into Gaza as an “unjustly, outrageously thin” lifeline and as “the gates to a living nightmare” where Palestinian civilians are “suffocating”.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said there is something “clearly wrong” with Israel’s military operations because of the number of civilians killed in the Gaza Strip. Guterres, speaking on Wednesday, said it is “absolutely essential” to have a flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza to meet the “dramatic” needs of the population in the Palestinian territory.

Foreign ministers from the G7 called Wednesday for a “humanitarian pause” in the war between Israel and Hamas to allow essential supplies to be delivered to desperate civilians in Gaza. Speaking to reporters after a meeting in Tokyo, Japan’s foreign minister, Yoko Kamikawa, said the G7 had confirmed the need for “urgent action to address the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza.

Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has called for a significant humanitarian pause in Gaza to allow for the release of all hostages and the delivery of aid to the Palestinian territory. Canada had previously called for a series of halts in the fighting but had steered clear of advocating a longer pause.

US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, again rejected calls for ‘a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel on Wednesday. He told the media in a press briefing in Tokyo “those calling for an immediate ceasefire have an obligation to explain how to address the unacceptable result that would likely bring about. Hamas left in place, with more than 200 hostages, with the capacity and stated intent to repeat 7 October, again, and again and again.”

Blinken also set out the US position on what he described as “a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in states of their own”. He said the only way to “durable peace and security” was “no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza … no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism … No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besieged Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza”. He later added that “Gaza cannot be continued to be run by Hamas. It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict.”

The Palestine Red Crescent Society has said all roads are closed heading to al-Quds hospital, and that “medical teams are unable to leave the hospital to reach the injured persons”.

The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt was closed on Wednesday due to an unspecified “security circumstance”, a US state department spokesperson said, without providing additional details. The US expects the crossing will be reopened at “regular intervals” so that aid can enter the Gaza Strip and foreign nationals can continue to depart, Vedant Patel said."

Israel has revised downwards the death toll from last month’s Hamas attacks in the south of the country from 1,400 to about 1,200, a foreign ministry spokesperson said. The revision is “due to the fact that there were lot of corpses that were not identified and now we think those belong to terrorists … not Israeli casualties,” they said on Friday.

The largest hospital in Gaza, where up to 50,000 people are sheltering, is facing bombardment, the World Health Organization has said. Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. Graphic daytime videos posted online appeared to show screaming and bloodied people, including children, in the grounds of al-Shifa hospital in the heart of Gaza City.

While many are familiar with Edward Said’s book Orientalism, his lesser-known work published a year later in 1979, The Question of Palestine, is no less important. In it, Said discusses many facets of the Palestinian experience, including the Nakba – the catastrophe of forced displacement to which 700,000 Palestinians and their descendants were subjected – and explores the misrepresentation of Palestine and Palestinians in the west – a subject as controversial today as it was nearly four decades ago.

Learning about the history of Palestine is a constant process of myth-busting. Among the most egregious is the idea that Palestine was a desert before Zionist immigration made it “bloom”. In Before Their Diaspora, Walid Khalidi, a historian from Jerusalem, has compiled a collection of images that show late Ottoman and British Mandate Palestine as a place roaring with culture, vitality and personality. The photographs range from pleasantly workaday images of farmers to bustling cities and resistance fighters.

The Al-Nakba: The Palestinian Catastrophe series available on YouTube is one of the most comprehensive documentaries about the root causes of the Israel-Palestine conflict. It draws on interviews with experts, Palestinian and Israeli, as well as survivors of massacres and displacements that led to where we are today. The film-makers Benny Brunner and Alexandra Jansse elegantly jump from past to present, providing a picture that is rich in detail and extensive in subject, leaving the viewer with an all-round understanding of the history of the conflict.

Broadcast by Channel 4 in 2011, The Promise tells the story of a young British woman (Claire Foy) who goes to Israel to stay with her friend’s wealthy family. There, as she witnesses the brutality of the Israeli occupation in Gaza and the West Bank, she reads the diaries of her grandfather, a British soldier stationed in Palestine after the second world war. The drama shifts back and forth between 1948 and 2005, underpinned by interviews with British veterans, members of armed Zionist groups, spies, peace activists and soldiers.

Ella Shohat comes from an Iraqi-Jewish background. In her collection of essays Taboo Memories, Diasporic Voices, published in 2006, she engages postcolonial thought from the perspective of Mizrahi or Arab-Jews, who come from the Middle East and north Africa, developing a rich critique of Eurocentric epistemology. This has changed the way I see the fabric of Israeli society and helped me feel more in solidarity with the Mizrahi Jews.

I have spent the past five weeks sitting on my hotel balcony for a few hours each day looking at the honey-coloured stone walls of the Old City of Jerusalem and listening to the competing sounds of Christian church bells, the muezzin’s plaintive call to prayer and the muttering of the Talmud, recited by Orthodox Jews in our hotel. Intruding into this soundscape of religion and history is the occasional air raid siren and the constant cacophony of cable news, in Hebrew, Arabic and English. It’s like living in the hifi shop from hell. It demands some context from the written or spoken word. I would begin with reading Simon Sebag Montefiore’s excellent Jerusalem: A Biography. It explains beautifully the competition for cramped real estate of the three monotheistic religions in this place that feels once again like the vexed navel of the world. It will make you appreciate the blessing and the curse of this city. For more historical context about the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict I recommend A Peace to End All Peace by David Fromkin. It charts the disastrous carving up by imperial Britain and France of the Arab world after the collapse of the Ottoman empire.

For a pause in the reading I recommend the very engaging editions of William Dalrymple and Anita Anand’s Empire podcasts on the Sykes-Picot Agreement and the Balfour Declaration. We Brits have a lot to answer for.

If you want to understand the twisted evolution of Hamas, and the role that Israel played in nurturing an extremist movement that helped undermine the more moderate Palestinian Authority, then try Hamas: The Islamic Resistance Movement by Beverly Milton-Edwards and Stephen Farrell. One of the accusations levelled by Israelis against their embattled prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is that he never embraced a two-state solution and told his Likud party that supporting Hamas would undermine the existence of a separate Palestinian state precisely because Hamas never recognised the right of Israel to exist. He wanted to bolster an impossible partner for peace while dividing the Palestinian camp. Hamas obliged him with their brutality. Their rule of the Gaza Strip which has been described as an open-air prison is akin to vicious inmates running the penitentiary.

To understand the politician who has dominated Israeli politics for a decade and a half and who even many of his supporters now predict is finished, the best book is Anshel Pfeffer’s Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu. The best leaders who have shown the requisite courage for peace – Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin – have tragically been assassinated by extremists in their own camps. If you still have an appetite for more on this moral and political pretzel of a subject I thoroughly recommend the drama Fauda on Netflix. In a landscape dominated by brutal caricatures of Israelis and Palestinians this is full of nuance and tortured humanity.

When you read the news, it’s very divided: you’re either with the Israelis or the Palestinians. But in literature, at least in good literature, it’s not about good guys and bad guys, it’s about humanism and trying to create a more complex narrative.

Cinderella is a short story by Sayed Kashua, an Israeli-Palestinian author now based in America. Originally written in Hebrew, it’s about a Jewish guy who, every night at midnight, turns into a pro-Palestinian Arab man. It’s very funny, but more than that, Kashua tackles the idea that there’s always this split, that you can’t fully integrate both narratives.

David Grossman’s To the End of the Land is a key novel in Israeli literature that portrays how trauma is transmitted through the generations. The protagonist is an Israeli mother desperately trying to protect her son, who has been recruited to the army. It’s about realising that your kids are reliving the same nightmare all over again because your generation wasn’t smart enough to create something different.

A generation younger than Grossman, Eshkol Nevo creates a very complex narrative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his novel Homesick, set in a Jewish village that was once an Arab village – the former inhabitants were evacuated in the war of independence. Nevo depicts with great compassion and insight both a Palestinian construction worker whose family once lived in this village and an Israeli boy whose brother was killed in a military operation.

All the Rivers by Dorit Rabinyan is a love story between a Palestinian man and an Israeli woman who meet when they are both screened by the US authorities as potential threat. It’s a modern-day Romeo and Juliet.

Etgar Keret’s short story Cocked and Locked encapsulates the entire conflict in just a few pages, with an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian fighter facing one another in the occupied territories. It’s such a brilliant story, asking who is the victim and who is the aggressor – and what does it mean to win? It addresses the struggle to remain human inside dehumanising propaganda on both sides.

Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer, Orwell prize-winning author and co-founder of the human rights organisation Al-Haq. His latest book is We Could Have Been Friends, My Father and I: A Palestinian Memoir (Profile Books)

Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance by Tareq Baconi is one of the best books on Hamas. Drawing on publications from the group as well as interviews with its leaders, it charts the rise of Islamic Palestinian nationalism and describes Hamas as a multifaceted liberation organisation that is rooted in the nationalist claims of the Palestinian people.

Victor Kattan’s From Coexistence to Conquest: International Law and the Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1891-1949 begins with antisemitism, colonialism and Zionism and ends with the creation of Israel. It describes in a lucid and scholarly manner how Jews and Palestinians were caught up in the net of great-power politics and analyses critical early decisions that led to the failure of the international community to resolve the conflict over Palestine.

The Bride and the Dowry: Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians in the Aftermath of the June 1967 War by Avi Raz examines the first two years after the 1967 war that resulted in the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Raz describes Israel’s foreign policy of deception showing how, while King Hussein of Jordan and the West Bank Palestinians were eager to make peace, Israel’s postwar diplomacy was in bad faith, preferring land over peace.

Arna’s Children, a 2004 Dutch–Israeli documentary film by Juliano Mer-Khamis, follows the life of four Palestinians, three of whom later died while resisting the Israeli army. The story revolves around a children’s theatre group in Jenin which was established by Arna Mer-Khamis, the director’s mother.

Since 7 October, I’ve been unable to read. When I need the solace that I usually get from reading, right now I just listen to music, and almost every day I end up playing My Baby Boy by the Israeli band theAngelcy. The line that’s always in my mind is “Tossing and turning in his bed / My baby boy’s already dead.” It’s not about the specific fear for your child as much as the understanding that the unbearable reality you’re dealing with is here to stay. We’re heading to a bad place and we just keep on going.

If you have the capacity to read at the moment, I would recommend Dancing Arabs by Sayed Kashua, a Palestinian writer who grew up in Israel. It is a funny and heartbreaking coming-of-age novel that deals with the conflict from a critical yet extremely human perspective. It’s very supportive of the Palestinian cause and critical of Israeli policies, but at the same time it does not see the Israelis as the other. That is very, very rare in this conflict.

Today we live in an age of selective empathy. Most people say, what side am I on? Who should I feel sorry for and whose pain should I disregard? This is a very Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut is about a different conflict – the bombing of civilians in Dresden during the second world war – but to me it’s proof that empathy can and should transcend any nationality or ideological narrative one holds.

Bethlehem (2013), a film by Yuval Adler, portrays the relationship between an Israeli secret service operative and a Palestinian teenager whom he recruits as an informer. It’s a little bit like a Mediterranean version of The Wire in that it’s really not judgmental: it is able to understand the tragedy and the suffering of all the characters, even the ones who are doing horrible things.

Finally, read any book you can find about Hamas’s history and ideology. In the past month I’ve encountered so many people who had a very heated and passionate take on Hamas and at the same time knew nothing at all about the murderous, homophobic, fundamentalist history of this organisation or its leader, Yahya Sinwar (nicknamed “the Butcher” after confessing to murdering 12 Palestinians whom he suspected of being collaborators). To Know Hamas by Shlomi Eldar is one place to start: it tells not only the story of the rise of Hamas in Gaza but also how it was in the Israeli rightwing’s interest to strengthen Hamas as a counterweight to the Palestinian Authority.

It is often called a complex conflict and yet, as Ta-Nehisi Coates recently said, “the most shocking thing is how not complicated it actually is”. As a writer and researcher who grew up in East Jerusalem, immersed in this so-called conflict, I can agree. The situation is not, in fact, so intimidatingly opaque (and neither, indeed, is genocide). Nur Masalha’s Palestine: A Four Thousand Year History, which traces the story of the Palestinians from the bronze age to the present day, portrays this beautifully; Israeli historian Ilan Pappé’s The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, first published in 2006, pretty much sums it up (for a digest that covers both, visit the brilliant decolonizepalestine.com). Ian Black’s Enemies and Neighbours: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017, meanwhile, offers a very readable overview of the last century.

I would recommend reading any of the memoirs of the Orwell-prize-winning Palestinian writer Raja Shehadeh which, with their lyrical prose, bring to life the realities of the occupation and its history, often through the lens of nature and landscape. For a different perspective, Israeli-Palestinian Sayed Kashua’s Native – a selection of his satirical Ha’aretz newspaper columns – is another deeply personal, often tragicomic, account of day-to-day living as a Palestinian within Israel. More sweeping, but no less absorbing, views of the Palestinian experience can be found in Susan Abulhawa’s exquisite novel, Against the Loveless World, which is both a love story and a moving portrayal of Palestinian resistance, and Hala Alyan’s Salt Houses, a stirring account of Palestinian displacement.

If reading feels like too much right now or you are tight on time, The Present, a 20-minute film currently on Netflix, is a short but eye-opening glimpse of what life is like for Palestinians in the West Bank, while Joe Sacco’s Footnotes in Gaza is an incredible piece of comic-book reportage that centres on Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border. An episode of Jewish Currents’s On the Nose podcast from last October, titled Gaza Under Blockade, presents a particularly relevant analysis of Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank.

I can’t think of a more profound documentary on the occupation than The Law in These Parts by Israeli film-maker Ra’anan Alexandrowicz. It is unique in its exploration of the complicity of the Israeli judicial system in the violation of Palestinian rights. On its face it’s a very simple work. But I don’t know of any anti-occupation activist who can name a film that is a deeper and more thorough examination of Israel’s system of control.

Gaza Mon Amour is a beautiful feature film by Arab and Tarzan Nasser, twin brothers who grew up in Gaza. It captures the ordinary lives of Gazans, their sense of humour, their spirit of resilience and, rather bravely, the scepticism that many Gazans have towards their leaders. It’s a love story about an old fisherman who inadvertently pulls up an ancient statue of Apollo in his fishing net. The story follows his entanglement with the authorities and his late-in-life romance with a woman that he meets in the streets of Gaza.

The Iron Wall is perhaps the most revealing essay ever published on the struggle over Palestine. Written in 1923 by Vladimir Jabotinsky, a rightwing founder of the Revisionist Zionist movement, it captures the essence of the dilemma of the Zionist movement in attempting to transform historic Palestine into the Land of Israel against the will of the native majority. It’s an extraordinarily frank essay that is as relevant today as it was then.

Israel: A Colonial Settler State?, by Jewish-French historian Maxime Rodinson, is a very short book that is that is among the sharpest pieces of historical analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Despite having been written in 1967, just before the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, all of the issues that it touches on are still with us today.

The Politics of Dispossession is a collection of Edward Said’s essays which includes the most prescient early criticism of the 1993 Oslo accords, which Said foresaw would not lead to Palestinian freedom and which he referred to as “an instrument of Palestinian surrender, a Palestinian Versailles”."

At least 195 Palestinians were killed in two rounds of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Hamas-run government media office said. Israel claims it killed senior Hamas officials in both attacks. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said Muhammad A’sar, the commander of Hamas’s anti-tank guided missile array, was targeted in Wednesday’s airstrike. The UN human rights office said Israel’s airstrike on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday could amount to war crimes. The UN’s humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said the airstrikes were “just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza” and said the world “seems unable, or unwilling, to act”.

Eighteen Israeli soldiers have been killed amid fierce fighting in Gaza, in a series of incidents that have underlined the mounting challenges facing the IDF in their attempts to push further into built-up areas of Gaza.

A letter published in the Guardian pits several prominent German and international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen Habermas.
They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to genocide.
Likening the resulting bloodshed in Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of acceptable debate, he said.
“The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,” it adds.";"The phrase “Never again” has been the central tenet of Germany’s political identity since the horrors of the Nazi-led Holocaust of Europe’s Jewish population. But the war between Israel and Hamas has opened up a fiercely fought debate about the phrase’s true meaning, dividing opinion among followers of the dominant German intellectual tradition.

A letter published in the Guardian pits several prominent German and international figures influenced by the Frankfurt School of neo-Marxist “critical theory” against its most prominent living member, Jürgen Habermas. They argue that “Never again” must also mean staying alert to the possibility that what is unfolding in Gaza could amount to genocide.

In a statement published on 13 November, Habermas made the case that the “Never again” principle must above all lead to a German commitment to protecting Jewish life and Israel’s right to exist.

Habermas, 94, sometimes described as a contemporary successor to the Enlightenment philosophers for his writing on themes of power and justice, argued that Israel’s military retaliation following the 7 October Hamas attacks was “justified in principle”. Likening the resulting bloodshed in Gaza to a genocide was beyond the boundaries of acceptable debate, he said.

“Despite all the concern for the fate of the Palestinian population […], the standards of judgment slip completely when genocidal intentions are attributed to Israel’s actions,” said the statement, which was also signed by the political scientist Rainer Forst, the lawyer Klaus Günther and the peace researcher Nicole Deitelhoff.

In response, the letter published on Wednesday echoes Habermas’s condemnation of the Hamas attack and hostage-taking, but expresses concern over the “apparent limits of the solidarity expressed” by the philosopher and his co-authors.

“The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction,” it adds. “Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.”

The letter continues: “We are concerned that there is no mention of upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and places of worship.”

While “not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide have been met” by the situation in Gaza, the letter says, all of them “agree this is a matter of legitimate debate”.

On Sunday, a group of UN experts said there was “evidence of increasing genocidal incitement” against the Palestinian people. Israeli officials reject this.

The letter’s full list of more than 100 supporters includes several academics who have either directly emerged from the Frankfurt School or are employed at New York’s New School for Social Research, which sees itself working within the same critical theory tradition.

Other signatories include the economist Adam Tooze, the legal historian Samuel Moyn, and the philosophers Amia Srinivasan and Nancy Fraser.

More than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants on 7 October. Since Israel’s counter-offensive was launched , more than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health authorities.

On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed a deal for the release of 50 women and children hostages held in Gaza in return for 150 Palestinian women and children to be freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire.

Founded in 1923, the Frankfurt School applied Marxist theory to philosophy and social theory to make sense of the rise of fascism out of apparently liberal European societies. Habermas, a former assistant to Theodor Adorno, took a more optimistic stance than the institution’s founding members, seeking to build an intellectual framework for democratic societies operating within market capitalism.

Habermas’s letter reflects a strong, cross-party pro-Israel consensus in German politics. The to-and-fro of statements comes on the back of a motion for a resolution put forward on 7 November by the three centre-left and liberal parties of Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, which proposes allowing the extradition of non-German citizenship holders who spread hatred against Jews, as well as withdrawing funding from cultural institutions that support the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

Critics fear such a resolution would also result in the silencing of legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. In Berlin, the city senate is considering pulling funding for the Oyoun cultural centre in the German capital’s Neukölln district, after the centre’s directors reportedly refused to cancel a peace vigil by a leftwing Jewish group."

“It doesn’t take hours or a genius in Gaza to know about Israeli army operations or Hamas operations,” he said.";"Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has produced the deadliest month for journalists since statistics began more than three decades ago, and created a news blackout in the embattled territory, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said.

The reporters’ watchdog has recorded the deaths of 48 reporters since Hamas embarked on a murderous killing spree in Israel on 7 October, triggering a concerted Israeli bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza in response.

The committee had already labelled the first month after the Hamas attacks as the most lethal suffered by journalists since 1992 before six more Palestinian journalists were killed in Gaza over the weekend.

Five were killed on Saturday alone, making it the second deadliest of the war apart from the day of Hamas’ attack, when six journalists lost their lives.

The spiralling death toll over a six-week period compares with the 42 journalists killed worldwide in the whole of 2022, including 15 who died covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, widely considered a highly dangerous conflict for news media.

The CPJ says the lethal trend also far outstrips the 30 journalists killed at the height of the Syrian civil war, previously regarded as the deadliest war zone for journalists in recent times.

Now the organisation has issued an urgent plea to Israel and its western allies to reform the rules of engagement deployed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to prohibit the use of lethal force against journalists bearing press insignia.

Sherif Mansour, the committee’s coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, said the rising number of media fatalities combined with successive cuts to internet and phone networks, and tightening censorship, were effectively imposing an information blackout on Gaza, a tiny coastal territory that is home to an estimated 2.3 million Palestinians. It meant a dearth of information for a population desperate to know where to obtain food, fuel and clean water, he said.

“Reporting the conflict has become so much more dangerous because of the exponential risk to local Palestinian journalists who are on the frontline and have no safe haven and no way out,” Mansour said.

“Also the Israeli army has refused to take any responsibility for the killings, saying to the international media organisations that they cannot guarantee the safety of the media or their employees.

“We have said, especially after the army targeted communications facilities, that we have reached a news blackout. We also have the problems with censorship, assaults and detentions in the West Bank.”

Ninety percent of the journalists killed have been Palestinians, with the exception of four Israeli reporters killed in the Hamas attacks, and one Lebanese citizen. The majority of the Palestinians killed have been freelancers and photo-journalists.

“They are the most needed right now but they are also the most vulnerable,” said Mansour.

Another nine journalists have been injured and a further three are missing. Thirteen have been arrested as part of what is described as an Israeli “censorship regime” introduced under emergency legislation making it an offence to damage “national morale” or “national security”.

It is unclear how many journalists were covering the conflict at the times of their deaths. But the CPJ is investigating each instance to see if reporters were caught in the crossfire while trying to do their jobs, Mansour added.

The grim tally has prompted the committee to renew calls initially made before the outbreak of the latest hostilities for Israel to reform its rules of engagement so that clearly identified journalists are protected.

“Last May, we said the IDF must change their rules of engagement to stop unleashing the use of lethal forces against journalists and media organisations,” said Mansour, who cited a previous CPJ report, Deadly Pattern, which said 13 out 20 journalists killed in Gaza before the current war had been wearing or carrying press markings at the time.

“We have not seen any indication that this has been done. This time, therefore, we have also called on Israel’s allies, including the United States, Britain and other European countries to pressure it to stop any use of lethal force against journalists.”

The call for protective measures follows claims this month by an Israeli media advocacy group, HonestReporting, that some international media outlets knew about Hamas’s 7 October attack in advance, citing the publication of pictures taken by local journalists showing the group storming into Israeli territory.

HonestReporting subsequently withdrew the accusations in the face of the organisations’ denials but not before the office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, issued a statement calling journalists who had photographed the event accomplices in “crimes against humanity”. Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, said they should be treated as terrorists and hunted down.

Days after the report, the home of Yasser Qudih, a freelance photographer who provided pictures of the Hamas attack to Reuters, was struck by four missiles. Qudih survived the strike but eight members of his family were killed. It is unclear whether Israel launched the strike.

Mansour called the HonestReporting claim a “smear campaign” that put Palestinian journalists’ lives in danger and said it was consistent with previous “false narratives” implying that Palestinian reporters were involved in terrorist activity.

“It doesn’t take hours or a genius in Gaza to know about Israeli army operations or Hamas operations,” he said. “You are talking about a 20-mile-long strip that is six miles wide. There are so many ways journalists could be at the scene – it doesn’t take any inside knowledge to open the window and look at the sky and see where the operation is.”"

We have lost the lens of intellectuals in the postwar period, who excavated the connections between racism, colonialism and antisemitism.
But this obscures the thing that propelled so many European Jews into Palestine in the first place: centuries of endless European antisemitism culminating in the Holocaust.
There would be no Jewish national project in Israel had there been no deadly antisemitism racing across Europe at that time.
Rachel Shabi is the author of Not the Enemy: Israel’s Jews from Arab Lands.";"On Saturday, hundreds of thousands took part in a history-making march for Gaza, while the hate mobs imagined by the now former home secretary Suella Braverman turned out to be the far right, who clashed with police. It’s true that the Palestine solidarity march did contain a fringe of hateful messages, but to portray these as characteristic of the whole is absurd. Protesters called for a halt to the death, catastrophe and terror being inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza. Demands for a ceasefire are accelerating globally, as about 11,000 people have been killed in the sealed Gaza Strip, including over 4,000 children – and with thousands more injured or orphaned. The Palestinian cause is close to the hearts of leftists, but polling shows it goes wider than that: most of the British public support a ceasefire.

Saturday’s demonstration contained a sizeable Jewish bloc, who marched despite alarmist warnings across our politics and media that the protests were hotbeds of antisemitism. Jewish people (me included) attend Gaza solidarity marches for many reasons. But I would bet that none include giving free passes on antisemitism to leftists – and neither should a Jewish presence be used to discount the existence of any such prejudice at these protests. More likely, we understand that while this ancient hatred can appear anywhere, it is not the fault of Palestinians that Christian Europe has a long, lingering and largely unacknowledged problem with antisemitism.

To even begin to address this in the midst of a gut-wrenching assault on Gaza means first to acknowledge that the role of progressive movements is currently complicated. We need two parallel conversations. One is in redress of the longstanding double standard exposed by global leaders greenlighting Israel’s intolerable pounding of Gaza. After the Hamas atrocities of 7 October, during which 1,200 were killed in a violent rampage and over 200, among them children, taken hostage, we rightly saw an outpouring of sympathy for the horrors unleashed in Israel. But western leaders are mostly muted in the face of unimaginable suffering in Gaza, bankrolling Israel’s battering of buildings and people, or calling only for humanitarian “pauses”, which despairing aid agencies have described as useless. There is a dismally familiar hypocrisy over whose lives count – all the more so in the context of this decades-long, asymmetric conflict, with Palestinians living under a violent Israeli occupation and a system several human rights groups have described as apartheid.

But a second conversation is needed within progressive movements from which many Jews are now – often reluctantly – absent. Those gruesome Hamas attacks left Jewish people reeling in pain and fearful over an alarming, global spike in antisemitism. To make matters worse, the Israeli government points to Jewish trauma over those Hamas crimes as justification for its assault on Gaza, while the British right corrals the pain into its own culture-war agenda. Progressives are justifiably concentrating on Gaza now, but in doing so are often not speaking to the agony of a shaken Jewish minority that may not be able to focus only on this urgent bigger picture. Fear and trauma generate many different responses. Absent any acknowledgment of that, or a space in which to share it, many Jewish stalwarts of the Palestinian cause, never mind recent supporters, are simply not showing up.

All of which taps into deeper issues with the left’s conception of the Israel-Palestine conflict and antiracism more generally. With antisemitism too often viewed as historic, its abiding contours are barely examined – not even in Britain, which invented the blood libel conspiracy against Jews that fuelled centuries of Europe-wide persecution. Antisemitism is rarely placed within a catalogue of European racism that encompassed colonialism and slavery, with each distinct and particular racism influencing the other. We have lost the lens of intellectuals in the postwar period, who excavated the connections between racism, colonialism and antisemitism. The political theorist Hannah Arendt, among others, argued that the racist violence of European colonialism in Africa both shaped and paved the way for the hateful Nazi antisemitism, premised on racial hierarchy, that led to the unique horrors of the Holocaust. After visiting the Warsaw ghetto in 1949, the African-American civil rights giant WEB Du Bois wrote that the experience gave him “a broader conception of what the fight against race segregation, religious discrimination and the oppression by wealth had to become if civilisation was going to triumph and broaden in the world”.

Meanwhile, the common leftist view of Israel’s origins as colonial is borne out by the nation’s founding fathers describing it in these terms, while the Palestinians already living in that land experienced it as such in forced expulsions and dispossession. That same expansionist logic, one that violently displaces Palestinians, continues to this day in the illegal Jewish settlements network beyond Israel’s internationally recognised borders and into the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

But this obscures the thing that propelled so many European Jews into Palestine in the first place: centuries of endless European antisemitism culminating in the Holocaust. There would be no Jewish national project in Israel had there been no deadly antisemitism racing across Europe at that time. The Palestinian intellectual Edward Said expressed this duality in Israel’s formation by describing Palestinians as “victims of victims, the refugees of the refugees”.

We can add to that the experiences of Jews who had lived in Arab countries for millennia, with no reason to leave, yet ended up as the socioeconomically disadvantaged majority Jewish population in Israel. Mostly free of the pogroms that were a feature of Christian Europe, these communities were uprooted by a pincer of competing forces: Jewish nationalism in Israel and the Arab nationalisms of countries such as Iraq, trying to shake off the yoke of British imperialism.

None of this justifies the ongoing dispossession of Palestinians, or cancels their right to the same freedoms all humans deserve. Instead, it introduces a universalist understanding of antiracism, to complement the analysis of this conflict as a relentless power imbalance between oppressor and oppressed. It means we can view the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe), the Holocaust and the exodus of Jews from Arab lands as a tangle of communities caught in the expanse of European colonialism and extreme racial thinking. It opens up the possibility of a morally and politically coherent view of different racialised minorities, even while our experiences take distinct paths. It enables a rejection of any zero-sum competition over suffering and a rejection of the idea that the safety of one people can ever come at the expense of another. It allows us, in other words, to imagine a shared, equal future, in which everyone is free.

Ultimately, a just and enduring peace requires a two-state solution.";"It’s impossible to absorb the harrowing images in Israel and Gaza with anything less than distress and horror. Lasting peace has rarely seemed more out of reach.

This widespread human suffering means the need for a just and enduring peace has rarely been more pressing. The future for both Israelis and Palestinians depends on this being realised.

The status quo is failing everyone.

Australia has five core priorities in this crisis. Supporting civilians, helping prevent conflict from spreading, and reinforcing the need for a durable peace – all of which we pursue by working with countries that have influence in the region. At the same time, we seek to keep our country unified and assist Australians abroad.

About 2,000 previously registered Australians have now left Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. After weeks of negotiation, 25 Australians and family members have crossed the border at Rafah in recent days; we persist in trying to secure passage for those still in Gaza.

And we remain deeply concerned about potential escalation in Lebanon, with an estimated 15,000 Australians there. We urge Australians to leave on the first available commercial option.

The number of Australians across the region underlines how close to home this conflict is. I have spoken with people who have lost loved ones on 7 October, as well as people who have lost loved ones in Gaza.

As Australians who treasure our peaceful community and aspire to ever greater unity as a nation, we mourn every innocent life which has been lost in this conflict.

Australian communities are in pain, felt most acutely in Jewish and Palestinian communities. There is a long, complex and disputed history – unfathomable trauma – deeply felt; close to the heart of many.

With pain so real and so raw, I understand why calls for peace can be hard to hear.

Some 1,400 Israelis were killed by Hamas on 7 October, the biggest loss of Jewish life on any day since the Holocaust. We condemn these terrorist attacks unequivocally: they cannot and should not be justified. And with more than 200 people still held captive, we call for Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all hostages.

In Israel’s response to those attacks, thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including more than 3,500 children, as reported by Unicef. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens by the day.

With grief and anger engulfing communities across the region, the promise of peace and security – for Israelis and Palestinians alike – recedes even further.

Food, water, medicine, fuel and other essential assistance must reach people in desperate need, and civilians – including Australians – must be able to get to safety. We have contributed $25m in aid, but more assistance is required from parties to the conflict if this aid is to reach Gazans.

This is why so many countries, like Australia, have been calling for humanitarian pauses on hostilities as a necessary first step.

In affirming Israel’s right to defend itself, Israel’s friends – including Australia – have consistently emphasised that the way it does so matters. We know it is extremely difficult to defeat a craven terrorist group that has burrowed itself in civilian infrastructure, using civilians as a shield.

Like Australia, Israel is a democratic nation state, pledged to the rule of law. The standards democracies seek and accept are high. That means Israel must observe international law and the rules of war.

So when Israel’s friends urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, it is critical that Israel listens. It matters for innocent civilians, who should not pay for horrors perpetrated by Hamas. And it matters for Israel’s own security, which faces grave risk if conflict spreads. The international community will not accept ongoing civilian deaths.

It is not possible to assure the interests of Israelis without also assuring the same for Palestinians.

A durable peace calls for people to see each other’s humanity. It requires all sides to respect the right of others to exist.

It will require the dismantling of Hamas – which doesn’t represent the Palestinian people – and a reformed, legitimate Palestinian Authority that disavows violence.

It will require serious international investment in the Palestinian economy, so Palestinians can build a future for themselves.

And it will require Israel to stop establishing settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories – that even the divided UN security council agreed is a “flagrant violation” of international law and a “major obstacle” to peace. Settler violence against Palestinians must cease and perpetrators held to account.

Demand is growing among the international community – west, east, north and south – for a political process. Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort reinforcing the imperative of a durable peace.

Ultimately, a just and enduring peace requires a two-state solution. An Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state. Israelis and Palestinians living securely and prosperously within internationally recognised borders.

I understand why people doubt that can be achieved. But I ask with all sincerity, what is the alternative?"

This month, the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate began organising a Palestine event featuring songs from the popular resistance of Suez in 1956.";"Israel’s unfolding genocide in Gaza is shaking relations between states and citizens across the Middle East. In Egypt, events have pushed the political regime’s comfortably obscured cooperation with Israel into the limelight, and have jolted millions of Egyptians out of their inward focus on daily survival amid spiralling inflation and unemployment. They are now confronted with Israeli plans to recolonise Gaza using Egypt as a conduit, by forcing Palestinians south into Sinai. Both the Egyptian state and its citizens reject this vehemently, but for different reasons. These differences reflect a chasm between the regime and the population opened by the signing of the Camp David accords in 1978, which events are widening further by the day.

Egyptians have a long history of support for the Palestinian cause, in the context of a shared Arab national identity. The public first opposed the Zionist colonisation project in the 1930s, and the army fought in the 1948 Palestine war. In the 1950s, Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, offered state support to the Palestinians and secured a political victory after the attack by Israel, Britain and France in 1956, but suffered defeat in the 1967 war with Israel. His successor, Anwar Sadat, secured an early victory in the 1973 war, when Egyptian troops crossed the Suez Canal to liberate Sinai, and Israel was only able to regain its balance after an airlift of US arms.

Nevertheless, Sadat later turned the Egyptian state towards “normalisation” with Israel. The population was incentivised away from protest by the US aid offered in return for what became the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinians lost their centrality in Egyptian public discourse, and were even smeared by some as responsible for their own misfortune. For more than 40 years, successive Egyptian regimes worked to establish Israel’s presence as a fact of life. The justification was Sadat’s claim that “the US holds 99% of the cards in the Middle East”, and that it was, therefore, futile to resist. The aim was to undo years of political, social and cultural intimacy between Egyptians and Palestinians, who were united in resistance to British colonialism years before Israel was founded.

This was never a successful project, however, and demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians would continually erupt. The savvy leadership of Hosni Mubarak allowed these protests in order to distract from people’s domestic woes. Yet eventually, they prepared the ground for the January 2011 uprising against him. Under current president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, all mass gatherings have been banned. Egyptians have been prevented from voicing their sympathies for the Palestinians, while being told to focus on making ends meet. As some have shrewdly observed, this left Egypt a regional anomaly, with no solidarity demonstrations during the Palestinian uprising of May 2021.

This was not so in October 2023, however: Israel’s violent impunity has triggered a popular reaction in Egypt that cannot be contained. For Egyptians, the events of 7 October signified the Palestinians breaking their siege, which pierced the steady news stream of abuses, detentions, executions, and land grabs in Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. Egyptians then felt a sense of impotence as the bombardment began, particularly given their geographical proximity to Gaza. Israel has repeatedly bombed the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border and obstructed aid convoys getting through. As the flow of devastating images continues, Egyptians’ grief and fury have mounted. Mosques host continuous prayers for the dead, becoming spaces for a collective processing of the horrors unfolding.

This powerful wave of sympathy has developed into a desire for active support. In Egypt’s stifled political atmosphere, many have turned to the tool of boycott, targeting western companies known to support Israel. For Egyptian youth in particular, Israel’s brutality and the west’s staunch support have been a wake-up call. Ever since the Camp David accords, many young Egyptians have looked to western popular and consumer culture, rarely questioning the credibility of the political language of human rights and democracy. Almost overnight, these myths have been shattered for millions of Egyptians, as they watch the endorsements of Israel flow out of Washington, Brussels and London, while the carnage in Gaza goes on. Some of those working in the NGO sector are reportedly debating the alternatives to western funding, and expressing profound unease at their dependence on it.

The same goes for many Egyptians’ understanding of the complicity of regional powers, particularly signatories of the Abraham accords such as the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, which had been preparing its own agreement. A recent arts festival in Riyadh was boycotted by Egyptian artists; those who went were heavily criticised. This month, the Egyptian Journalists Syndicate began organising a Palestine event featuring songs from the popular resistance of Suez in 1956. It has since launched the “world’s conscience convoy”, calling for an international coalition of volunteers to go to Rafah to pressure Israel into letting more aid through and demand an end to the war. Needless to say, both before and since the temporary truce, Egyptian public opinion opposes the Sinai plan as a new stage of ethnic cleansing in Palestine.

This is the atmosphere of mobilisation and frustration that envelops the Egyptian regime. The leadership has its own longstanding concerns that Israel wants to “export” the conflict to Egypt – these were confirmed by the leak of an Israeli intelligence document dated 13 October, proposing the “transfer” of Gaza’s Palestinians to the Sinai peninsula. This would mean housing thousands of refugees, and poses the risk of attracting Egyptians to the ranks of Palestinian armed groups, inviting Israeli strikes, or worse. Enjoying full US backing, Israel has exercised pressure on Egypt to accept, but Sisi has called Arab summits and spoken with US and European leaders, each time repeating the message of refusal.

The regime has tried to achieve this with the help of the Egyptian people. On 18 October, without any irony, the president said “millions” could be mobilised to resist US-Israeli pressure. Designated locations were soon shared online. Sisi planned to use this to absorb popular anger, and to send a message to the US, the EU and Israel that he simply could not accept the Sinai plan without risking his position.

As it happened, many who participated ended up going off script, heading for Tahrir Square. Some even chanted the 2011 uprising slogan, “Bread, freedom, social justice”, and insisted: “This is a real demonstration, not a mandate for anyone.” Police made more than 100 arrests, and Tahrir Square has since been fortified with armoured vehicles. Still, figures such as Al-Azhar Sheikh Muhammad Al-Tayyib have spoken out, endorsing Palestinian resistance, and demanding a re-evaluation of Egypt’s relations with the west.

The popularity of Palestine is such that the regime was able to harness it – despite its own record – for domestic and diplomatic leverage. Yet this popularity means it must also stay ahead of the curve, whether by containment or repression, lest Palestine activism boil over into domestic protest as it has done before. In the absence of organised opposition, this process may take years to develop, but there does appear to be a sense in which the lessons of the day – distinguishing friend from foe, truth from lies, power from resistance – are sharpening popular grievances. According to a friend, Egyptians are scrutinising themselves after years of post-revolutionary defeat: “We are like someone rising to their feet, after a hard blow.”"

Israeli forces on Friday targeted the convoy “transporting the wounded” from Gaza City towards Rafah in the south, according to the Hamas government in Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its ambulance was struck by a missile fired by Israeli forces. The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out an airstrike on an ambulance it said was being used by Hamas, and that “a number of Hamas terrorist operatives” were killed. The World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “utterly shocked” by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 9,227 Palestinians, including 3,826 children, since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Friday. The Israeli offensive on Gaza followed attacks launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October which killed 1,400 people.

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has warned it cannot provide safety to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians “sheltering under a UN flag”. More than 50 UN facilities have been “impacted” by the conflict – including “five direct hits” – and 38 people had died in UN shelters, Thomas White, the director of UNRWA affairs, said on Friday. “Let’s be very clear, there is no place that is safe in Gaza right now.”

UNRWA “is practically out of business”, the UN’s humanitarian chief said on Friday, as he paid tribute to at least 72 UNRWA staff killed in Gaza since 7 October. Martin Griffiths told UN member states in New York that what had unfolded over the past 26 days of conflict “is nothing short of … a blight on our collective conscience”.

The leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah has said his powerful militia is engaged in cross-border fighting with Israel and has threatened further “realistic escalation”. Hassan Nasrallah stopped short of announcing that Hezbollah had fully joined the Israel-Hamas war but warned that fighting on the Lebanon-Israel border would not be limited to the scale seen so far. The White House said Hezbollah should not try to take advantage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Talks are being held on a “very significant” pause in the Israel-Hamas war to win the release of hostages taken by Hamas, Agence France-Presse quoted a senior US official as saying. “It is something that is under a very serious and active discussion. But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done,” the official said on Friday. Reuters quoted a US official saying there was “indirect engagement” aimed at finding a way to get the hostages out and “it’s something we’re working on extremely hard”, but there was “absolutely no guarantee” it would happen. An estimated 240 Israeli and foreign hostages were kidnapped by Hamas during its 7 October assault.

Israel will continue its offensive in Gaza “with full force” and refuse any temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of the hostages held by Hamas, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said, rejecting US calls for a pause in the fighting. “I made clear that we are continuing full force and that Israel refuses a temporary ceasefire which does not include the release of our hostages,” he said on Friday.

Israeli forces have surrounded Gaza City and are attacking Hamas infrastructure and destroying tunnels used by militants to launch attacks, the Israeli military said on Friday. Airstrikes continued alongside the intensifying ground offensive in what Netanyahu described as the second stage of the war.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, flew into Israel on Friday to urge Netanyahu to temporarily stop Israel’s military offensive to allow aid into the territory. The US’s top diplomat applied the greatest pressure yet on the Israeli government to rethink its strategy in Gaza, calling for localised humanitarian pauses and insisting Israel cannot achieve long-term security solely through military means.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, saying “crimes against humanity” are being committed in Gaza. “There is no concept that could explain or excuse the brutality that we have witnessed since 7 October,” Erdogan said during a summit of Turkic states in the Kazakh capital, Astana.

France has reacted with “astonishment” and “incomprehension” after it said that an Israeli airstrike had hit the Institut Français in Gaza, and that the Gaza office of Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency was also hit. AFP said its Gaza City office was significantly damaged by a strike on the building on Thursday. No injuries have been reported.

Israeli forces on Friday killed six Palestinians in raids across the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said, as violence surged in the occupied territory in tandem with the Gaza war. The Israeli army said its forces were “operating against Hamas” across the West Bank, with operations in Jenin and the northern city of Nablus.

The US has confirmed for the first time that it has been flying unarmed surveillance drones over Gaza. The flights were “in support of hostage recovery efforts”, the Pentagon said.

The first people in a group of about 100 Britons due to leave Gaza on Friday have made the crossing into Egypt, amid concerns about whether individuals in the north of the Palestinian territory will be able to make it to the southern Rafah crossing. By Friday, there were 127 people on the UK list to be evacuated into Egypt since the crossing opened on Wednesday. The parents-in-law of Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, were among the Britons able to leave Gaza. It is understood hundreds of British nationals remain trapped in Gaza.

The White House has said 100 American citizens and family members left Gaza on Thursday. Another large group of Americans were expected to leave the territory on Friday, it said.

Thirty-four French citizens were evacuated from the Gaza Strip on Friday, according to the French foreign ministry.

Doctors and aid workers in Gaza say they have been abandoned by the international community to a “humanitarian tragedy” as they “fight to survive” after almost four weeks of war.

Thousands of Palestinian workers from Gaza who were stranded in Israel when war broke out last month have been deported back to the war-torn strip after being expelled by the Israeli government. The UN Human Rights Office said it was “deeply concerned” about the expulsions.

Rishi Sunak has described pro-Palestinian protests planned for London on Armistice Day as “provocative and disrespectful”. The UK prime minister’s intervention on Friday came as two women pictured at a pro-Palestinian march in London carrying photos of paragliders have been charged with terrorism offences."

To them, this is a time to advocate for their side and make a case for extremism against those they see as their mortal enemies. Both sides are guilty of this, believing that their suffering gives them a pass to encourage further suffering in others. So long as “their team” isn’t the one being hurt, it is justified.

The solution is to keep talking about peace and reconciliation, and to stamp out toxic ideas and prevent them from taking root. I, as a leftwing Muslim, have seen “progressives” ignore the plight of Jews to bolster their cause for Palestinian freedom. But that line of thinking is antithetical to progressivism, and responsible for isolating Israel and fuelling radical action undertaken by them. Tolerance must be universal, because hatred too is universal – anything less than the protection of both peoples ensures the destruction of both.

Support of Palestine is not inherently leftwing, and neither is support of Israel rightwing. This conversation goes beyond the realm of politics, crossing through the treacherous badlands of religious extremism. There is an assumption that only one side can be right, that only one side can be the victim, which destroys the possibility of peace. In reality, both sides are victims of a conflict that could have been avoided had the world been more kind towards Jews and more respectful of Palestinians.

I’m a leftist, American, Ashkenazi Jew in my mid-70s. I have Israeli relatives whose ancestors migrated there before the second world war. It has been a place of refuge and safety for my relatives ever since. But I have also been aware of the displacement of the Palestinians since the Nakba. Ever since the 7 October attack and the start of this present war, I have been struggling even more with the issues of fairness and justice. Thank you, Jon Lansman, for helping me better understand this long, complicated history and what’s happening in the present. Maybe I can rest my old soul a little.

As he was saying this, Biden was reiterating that an Israeli re-occupation of Gaza would be a very big mistake.
It was the first time the UN security council had come to a collective view on Israel and Palestine since 2016.
But Biden, a friend of Israel but not of Netanyahu, has his own calculations to make.";"On the surface, Joe Biden gave Israel a clear green light to continue its military campaign in Gaza on Wednesday night, and endorsed its claim that Hamas has been using the al-Shifa hospital as a command and control headquarters.

His remarks in San Francisco after a meeting with Xi Jinping will delight Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.

But the pattern of US behaviour since the war started is to provide public support alongside private caution. Behind the scenes the tensions are escalating, and issues around the Israeli strategy are unresolved.

Indeed, the frank admission by Eli Cohen, Israel’s foreign minister, on Monday that Israel had “two to three weeks” before it faced significant diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire may prove optimistic. It is said the IDF has prepared short- and long-term campaign plans, dependent on the political environment in which they operate.

Clues that Israel is under pressure are surfacing.

In San Francisco, Biden said the Israeli modus operandi in raiding the al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza showed Israel had changed. He said: “It is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an indiscriminate bombing,” implying the US had demanded a different tactic.

Western officials continue to ask searching questions about Israel’s future strategy.

One British diplomat said: “This idea of safe zones [for Gaza civilians] makes us very leery. You have to make sure you do not put people into jeopardy by kettling them into a location. The UN is very leery about safe zones and they are 100% correct because they all remember what happened in Srebrenica, northern Iraq and Rwanda. Yes, you can put a tented camp in the left-hand corner of Gaza, 5km up the coast and 1km in, it might sound good on paper, but the reality on the ground is you cannot do that unless everyone with a gun agrees to respect it.”

Similarly, the raid on the al-Shifa hospital has not been seen in Israel and the American press as quite the slam-dunk moment Biden presented. It was high-risk and high-reward in that it would, according to Israeli claims backed up by the US, reveal Hamas had indeed been using the hospital as a command and control centre.

1:39 Biden defends rejecting calls for ceasefire: Hamas 'plan on attacking Israel again' – video

The Jerusalem Post analysis, broadly supported by New York Times investigations, asked how 2,000 Hamas fighters had evaporated. Saudi, UAE and Qatari diplomats all issued statements dismissing the Israeli claims.

Israel may legitimately argue it needs more time to search through a vast complex and dig deep beneath the building, but more time was the plea of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq in 2003, and eventually they drew an embarrassing blank.

Most western officials are more inclined to believe Israel rather than Hamas, and it is striking that US intelligence before the raid claimed independently that Hamas had committed a war crime by installing a command post in the hospital. But in a very polarised war, each side is going to interpret the evidence to fit their prejudices.

The US also seems unhappy with what it is hearing of Israel’s postwar plans. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, insisted Israel could not leave a vacuum in Gaza and that this would require a very strong Israeli presence. As he was saying this, Biden was reiterating that an Israeli re-occupation of Gaza would be a very big mistake.

In New York, the US envoy to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said a sustained peace must put “Palestinian people’s voices and aspirations at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza”. She added: “It must include Palestinian-led governance, and Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. It must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction in Gaza. And it must ensure there is no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or violent attacks. And it must include a pathway to a two-state solution”. That leaves the US and Israel some way apart.

In this context it is possible to see the US decision to abstain rather than veto the UN security council resolution calling for prolonged humanitarian pause on Wednesday as significant. It was the UN’s fifth attempt to reach a common position.

The US had on 18 October raised a lonely hand to veto a more ambitious Brazilian resolution on the basis that the resolution did not criticise Hamas, or assert Israel’s right to self-defence. The latest resolution, drafted by Malta, also contained no criticism of Hamas – a point the US envoy made to the security council – but the US clearly felt the climate of diplomatic and public opinion had swung against Israel enough in the past month to make a further veto inadvisable.

It was the first time the UN security council had come to a collective view on Israel and Palestine since 2016. The resolution may have been a tepid call for pauses, and one that Israel immediately rejected, but as one NGO observer said sometimes you don’t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.

There is a further concern; western capitals are deeply worried by the spillover effect of Gaza on the global south’s support for sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

One senior former British diplomat said this week: “There is a lot of distrust here and a suspicion amongst their leaders that when we urge them to impose sanctions, the west does not hurt that much from sanctions but they do. This I fear will get worse because of what is going on in Gaza at the moment where they believe we show double standards and give what they will see as unconditional support for Israel. So the sooner that Gaza is over the better, but I would be surprised if there are no scars from this.”

Ultimately this may come down to political calculation. Netanyahu, judging by the polls, has no option but to plough on in the hope that he can regain the mantle of Mr Security and save his job by eliminating Hamas.

But Biden, a friend of Israel but not of Netanyahu, has his own calculations to make. The US’s strength is built on the quality and range of its international alliances, the so-called “shield of the republic”. That shield is looking battered to the extent that Iran, playing a canny diplomatic game, is broadening its friendships across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, no friends of Hamas, want this war over.

Most worrying for Joe Biden, so do the American people. A Reuters-Ipsos poll showed 68% of Americans supported a ceasefire."

Israeli forces continued their offensive against Hamas in northern Gaza, closing in on the Indonesian hospital where thousands of patients and displaced people have been sheltering for weeks. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “appalled” by reports that 12 people, including patients, were killed in overnight shelling at the last hospital operating in northern Gaza. Some 200 patients have been evacuated from the Indonesian hospital on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry has said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that health services in Gaza have suffered “catastrophic” damage, with most hospitals no longer functioning. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, warned that the thousands of injuries sustained by civilians across Gaza, combined with the growing public health crisis in the besieged enclave, is a “recipe for epidemics”. He also described Israel’s cooperation for humanitarian relief in Gaza as “subpar”.

The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said a clinic it operated in Gaza City was attacked on Monday morning. Part of the building was engulfed in flames, it said, and four marked MSF cars were burned while a fifth was found crushed by a heavy vehicle or a tank. The charity said it was not immediately aware of the status of one member of staff and 20 family members.

Twenty-eight premature babies were rescued from al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and taken to Egypt on Monday. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said 31 “very sick” babies were moved from al-Shifa hospital in a joint operation with the UN and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and 12 of them had been flown to Cairo. Three babies remain in Gaza.

Israel and Hamas appear to be edging towards a deal that would see the release of a significant number of hostages, possibly in return for a limited ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Joe Biden on Monday said he believed a deal is near, and the White House later said the US is “doing everything we can” and that it believed “we’re closer than we’ve ever been”.

Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have clashed with far-right Israeli politicians who want to bring in the death penalty as a possible sentence for captured Hamas members. The families said on Monday that even talk of doing so might endanger the lives of their relatives. The row underlines the deep divisions in Israel over how to deal with the hostage crisis.

The UN secretary general has said it is clear that the war in Gaza has seen “a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict” since he began his role in 2017. At a press conference on Monday, António Guterres also said he did not believe a UN protectorate in Gaza would be a solution to the conflict and that war must “move in a determined, irreversible way to a two-state solution”.

Relief trucks originally from Jordan entered Gaza from Egypt on Monday with the intention of setting up a new field hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.

The comments, made at the end of a G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Japan, echoed White House remarks on Tuesday suggesting opposition to a long-term occupation of Gaza.

The G7 called for humanitarian pauses in the conflict, and urged Israel to comply with humanitarian law, but did not say in its joint statement whether Israel was currently doing so.

By contrast the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said there was something “clearly wrong” with Israel’s military operations against Hamas when so many civilians were being killed.

“There are violations by Hamas when they have human shields,” Guterres said. “But when one looks at the number of civilians that were killed with the military operations there is something that is clearly wrong.”

He added: “It is also important to make Israel understand that it is against the interests of Israel to see every day the terrible image of the dramatic humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. That doesn’t help Israel in relation to the global public opinion.”

Giving his vision of Gaza after the destruction of the military power of Hamas, Blinken said: “Gaza cannot … continue to be run by Hamas; that simply invites repetition of 7 October,” referring to the attacks this autumn by Hamas in Israel in which at least 1,400 people were killed.

He added: “It’s also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict … We don’t see a reoccupation and what I’ve heard from Israeli leaders is that they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza.”

The British foreign minister, James Cleverly, said power should be transferred eventually towards “a peace-loving Palestinian leadership”.

His remarks were designed to match the US’s warning to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyhau, that Israel cannot rule Gaza once it has achieved its goal of eradicating the Hamas leadership. Netanyahu on Monday said Israel planned to be responsible for security in Gaza indefinitely.

Cleverly, speaking at the end of the G7 meeting, said: “In the short term, it is inevitable that Israel, because they have the troops in Gaza, will need to have a security responsibility.

“But our view is, as soon as practicable, a move towards a peace-loving Palestinian leadership is the most desired outcome.”

Neither Blinken nor Cleverly have put a timeframe on this transfer or the conditions that would need to be met before Israel would withdraw. But the establishment of a Palestinian leadership that Israel regarded as “peace loving” would in practice be more likely a matter of years rather than months.

Western diplomats are concerned that the secular and more moderate leadership of Fatah, which runs the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, is being systematically undermined in Gaza, making it difficult for the PA to gain support among Palestinians.

Some Israeli politicians have discussed fully reoccupying the Gaza Strip, which Israel left unilaterally in 2005. Other former security officials say Israel will not start settlements in Gaza, but must have permanent and complete security control of the occupied territory so as to prevent a repetition of the attack on 7 October. Palestinians would be responsible for civil administration.

Mark Regev, an adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel envisaged a fluid arrangement in which it had powers to enter Gaza to protect its security. He said: “It doesn’t necessarily mean a permanent presence. We can go in and we can go out, but after what Israel went through on 7 October, it’s clear that we’re not going to allow terrorists to reestablish control in Gaza.”

Blinken said the US vision involved “no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza – not now, not after the war”.

He added: “[There should be] no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism or other violent attacks. No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza. We must also ensure no terrorist threats can emanate from the West Bank.

“The reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict, but it is imperative that the Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza and in the West Bank as well, and that, again, we don’t see a reoccupation. And what I’ve heard from Israeli leaders is that they have no intent to reoccupy Gaza and retake control of Gaza.

“So the only questions are – is there some transition period that might be necessary, and what might be the mechanisms that you could put in place for that to make sure that there is security?”

He said Hamas had hijacked Palestinian aspirations, and ultimately the only way to counter that was not just killing terrorists but coming up with a better idea of Palestinians living side by side with Israel, with two states existing.

However, it is hard to see how an elected Palestinian leadership would be prepared to take over Gaza if Israel insists it retains complete control over all security issues.

The PA in the West Bank already believes it has been forced into the role of a security subcontractor for Israel.

The joint statement from the G7 group of western industrialised nations was silent on the issue of the future governance of Gaza, restricting itself to a pro-forma restatement of the need for a long-term two-state solution.

The statement also papered over the cracks in the G7 members’ stance towards Israel’s assault on Gaza by calling for humanitarian pauses, and highlighting the importance of protecting civilians.

There was nothing in the statement to say whether Israel was in breach of humanitarian law. Biden has confirmed that in a call on Monday he asked the Israeli prime minister to agree to a lengthy humanitarian pause, perhaps as long as three days. Netanyahu, in an interview with ABC, has spoken about a pause lasting hours.

The US has been briefing for days that it privately favours a significant humanitarian pause, believing it is the best way to secure the release of more than 240 hostages.

The G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Japan also called on Hamas to release hostages unconditionally and asserted Israel’s right to self-defence. Among the G7, France has probably been the lead country at the UN calling for a ceasefire if that is preceded by humanitarian pauses.

Behind closed doors, talks were to continue this Wednesday at the UN security council about the terms of a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause. Russia and the US remain at loggerheads, leaving the world’s primary security body silent on one of the biggest security crises to hit the Middle East in decades.

The G7 statement is unlikely to do much to satisfy countries such as Iran and Russia, which are accusing the west of double standards in the upholding of the international rule of law."

One month after Hamas’s attack killed 1,400 people, the Israeli prime minister also said he would consider hour-long “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow the entry of aid or the exit of hostages from the Gaza Strip, but again rejected calls for a ceasefire.

Asked who should “govern” Gaza after fighting ends, Netanyahu told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Monday night: “Those who don’t want to continue the way of Hamas.”

He added: “Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility [in Gaza] because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have that security responsibility.”

His comments offered the clearest indication yet that Israel plans to keep a tight grip over the territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians.

The United Nations and other world bodies, including the EU, consider Gaza as occupied – despite Israel withdrawing its forces from inside the strip in 2005 – as it has maintained effective control over the small territory by land, sea and air.

On Tuesday, a month since Hamas’s attack in southern Israel, people held a minute of standing silence across Israel to commemorate the victims.

The night before, a vigil in Jerusalem was held, with a candle lit for each victim.

Relatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem’s Western Wall where prayers were held marking the first month of grief, in line with Jewish tradition. “We don’t have other ways to commemorate them except with prayers, lighting candles, and having them in our heart,” Yossi Rivlin, whose two brothers were killed at a music festival massacre during the Hamas attack.

Standing before a giant Israeli flag, the army’s chief cantor, Shai Abramson, gave a prayer for the dead, modified to include a blessing for security forces personnel who had died.

Retaliating to the Hamas raid, in which fighters seized 240 hostages, Israel has bombarded the enclave in an assault that Gaza health officials say has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians, including about 4,100 children.

Both Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting calls for a halt in fighting. Israel says hostages should be released first. Hamas says it will neither free them nor stop fighting while Gaza is under assault.

Rights groups and UN experts have accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, began a five-day visit to the Middle East on Tuesday, although he had still not secured permission from Israel to visit.

“It has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair,” Turk said in a statement. “Human rights violations are at the root of this escalation and human rights play a central role in finding a way out of this vortex of pain.”

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said Gaza is becoming a “graveyard for children”, calling for an urgent ceasefire.

International organisations have said Gaza’s hospitals cannot cope with the wounded, and food and clean water are running out with aid deliveries nowhere near enough. “We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,” said a statement from the heads of several United Nations bodies.

On Monday, the Israeli military released video of tanks moving through bombed-out streets and groups of troops moving on foot. It says it has surrounded Gaza City, cutting off northern parts of the narrow coastal strip from the south.

The UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday. The 15-member body is still trying to agree a resolution after failing four times in two weeks to take action. Diplomats said a key obstacle was whether to call for a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities or humanitarian pauses to allow aid access in Gaza.

When asked on Monday if there had been any talks at the UN yet about what might happen in Gaza once the fighting stopped, the deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told reporters: “Obviously there is concern about what happens the day after, but we’re not at that point.”

On Saturday, several Middle East foreign ministers urged the US to persuade Israel to agree to a ceasefire in a meeting with the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat, however, dismissed the idea, saying such a halt would only benefit Hamas, allowing the militant organisation to regroup and attack again.

The diplomatic wrangling came as the conflict entered its fifth week, with reports that more than 30 people were killed in a strike on a refugee camp in central Gaza.

Palestinian news agency Wafa was the first to report on the bombing at Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp late on Saturday. Gaza’s Hamas-controlled health ministry said Israel had attacked the camp, adding that most of the dead were women and children.

An Israeli military spokesperson said it was looking into whether the Israel Defence Forces had been operating in the area at the time of the bombing.

Earlier on Saturday, Palestinians reported a deadly Israeli strike on a UN-run school in northern Gaza serving as a shelter.

Witnesses said the strike hit the al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia, where thousands of evacuees were living. At least 15 people died and dozens more were wounded, said a Gaza health ministry official, Mohammad Abu Selmeyah.

Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after the 7 October attack on communities near the border with Gaza which killed more than 1,400 people, mainly civilians. More than 240 Israeli and foreign hostages were also abducted during the attack.

The health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,480 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israeli strikes and the intensifying ground campaign.

The growing number of civilian deaths has intensified international calls for a ceasefire. The US has sought to persuade the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to accept localised pauses in fighting, but after meeting with Blinken on Friday the Israeli leader said there could be no “temporary truce” unless Hamas released the hostages it holds in Gaza.

On Saturday, Hamas officials said that more than 60 of the hostages being held in Gaza were missing after Israeli airstrikes. Late last month, Hamas said an estimated 50 captives held by the group were killed in strikes on Gaza.

Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said troops were fighting “hard” in Gaza, while the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, visited troops inside Gaza after they completed an encirclement of Gaza City.

The Israeli military describes Gaza City as “the centre of the Hamas terror organisation”, but the US special envoy for aid assistance, David Satterfield, said between 350,000 and 400,000 civilians remained in the city and adjacent areas.

The ongoing fighting has provoked political opposition from key regional powers, including Turkey, which on Saturday recalled its ambassador from Israel, hours before Blinken was set to arrive in Ankara for meetings with local officials.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told reporters he held Netanyahu personally responsible for the growing civilian death toll in Gaza. Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat said the move was “another step by the Turkish president that sides with the Hamas terrorist organisation”.

On Saturday, protests were held outside Netanyahu’s residence. Waving blue and white Israeli flags and chanting “Jail now!”, a crowd in the hundreds pushed through police barriers around the prime minister’s home in Jerusalem and were held back by police.

The protest, which coincided with a poll showing more than three-quarters of Israelis believe Netanyahu should resign, underlined the growing public fury at their political and security leaders.

Thousands also demonstrated in Tel Aviv, waving flags and holding photographs of some of the captives in Gaza and posters with slogans like “Release the hostages now at all costs” while crowds chanted “bring them home now”.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also staged protests on Saturday in cities around the world, including London, Berlin, Paris, Istanbul and Washington, to demand a ceasefire.

Both sides believe that the university administration is not taking their point of view – or concerns for their physical safety – seriously.
A nervous Columbia University administration closed the campus to the public.
Many students and faculty have called on Columbia in recent years to divest from Israel and cease curricular programs there, though the university has resisted.";"Except for the flickering police vans idling around Columbia University on a recent evening, the campus was almost the picture of an Ivy League idyll, with students striding past classical architecture in their autumnal best, clasping coffee cups.

Yet the conspicuously beefed-up security presence was one sign that all is not well at Columbia. Since the Israel-Hamas war began last month, fierce debates about the conflict and the US’s response have riven the university, with students clashing in dueling statements, rallies, and occasional physical confrontations. Hundreds of faculty members have also gotten involved.

The situation is acrimonious and shows no signs of abating: a rightwing, pro-Israel group has deployed a truck near campus with an electronic billboard exposing the identities of students that the group deems “Columbia’s Leading Antisemites”; a 19-year-old was charged with a hate crime after allegedly beating with a stick a student putting up a poster of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas; a swastika was found drawn in a bathroom; students wearing keffiyehs or hijabs have reportedly been harassed; and an unnamed Columbia administrative officer told a campus radio reporter, during a rally, that he hoped pro-Palestinian protesters would “die”.

The latest “war of words”, in the phrasing of one open letter, began not long after the bloody 7 October rampage in which Hamas and other armed groups killed 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostage. After officials at Columbia and its affiliated women’s college, Barnard, emailed students messages of concern that some students regarded as ignoring Palestinian suffering, groups of students and faculty began publishing a flurry of competing statements.

Both sides believe that the university administration is not taking their point of view – or concerns for their physical safety – seriously. Pro-Palestinian students walked out of a class taught by Hillary Clinton to protest what they view as the university’s pro-Israel bias; in contrast, some Jewish alumni, who have accused the university of being insufficiently sensitive to antisemitism, have begun posting pictures online of their diplomas flipped upside-down.

Similar controversies have divided universities across the country, but the discourse at Columbia has been so vociferous that it has even reached Israel. The comedy show Eretz Nehederet (“A Wonderful Country”), Israel’s answer to Saturday Night Live, did a recent sketch mocking an American college called Columbia Untisemity. In the somewhat strained segment, two naive, radical-chic US students with blue and pink hair brag about their support for LGBTQH rights (“H?” “Hamas”), then interview a Hamas guerrilla in an underground tunnel, whose hatred the students keep mistaking for mutual admiration: invited to visit America, he responds: “Yes, it will be a blast.”

On 9 October, the deans of different Columbia colleges and departments began issuing statements about the crisis in Israel-Palestine. Columbia’s undergraduate liberal arts college lamented “the horrific acts of violence and loss of life” in both Israel and Gaza. Palestinian officials report that Israel’s counter-attack has so far killed as many as 10,000 Palestinians, many of them children.

But messages sent by the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the School of General Studies did not mention Palestinians at all, and when the president of Barnard, Laura Rosenbury, tried to salve the situation, she fanned the flames further. “I am appalled and saddened to see antisemitism and anti-Zionism spreading throughout Barnard and Columbia,” she wrote, in an email which some students accused of equating legitimate protest with hatred of Jews.

The day after a pro-Palestinian activist allegedly assaulted a student hanging a poster, hundreds of students participated in simultaneous, dueling pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian rallies. A nervous Columbia University administration closed the campus to the public.

Around this time more than 20 student groups at Columbia endorsed a statement, “Oppression Breeds Resistance”, which acknowledged “tragic losses experienced by both Palestinians and Israelis” but declared that “there can be no future of safety and freedom for all Israelis and Palestinians without holding the Israeli occupation accountable for its actions and putting an end to the untenable status quo of Israel’s apartheid and colonial system”.

The statement’s signatories were subjected to what they describe as harassment and retaliation. Students “have had to get lawyers, they have been afraid to go to class, and they have faced physical and verbal attacks”, one undergraduate student who wished to remain anonymous said, adding that the reprisals had backfired: “[W]e are seeing pro-Palestinian activism and education spreading throughout campus on its own to an unprecedented degree.”

The temperature on campus continued to rise. On 21 October, the president of LionLez, a campus club for lesbian and nonbinary students, became embroiled in controversy after she advertised an event with the message “It’s FREE PALESTINE over here. Zionists aren’t invited”, and then, in a leaked email defending her earlier message, wrote, “white Jewish people are today and always have been the oppressors of all brown people,” “WHEN I SAY THE HOLOCAUST WASN’T SPECIAL, I MEAN THAT,” and “Israelites are the Nazis”.

Days later, a number of left-leaning and pro-Palestinian faculty members, concerned at the treatment of pro-Palestinian students who signed the earlier joint statement, published an open letter “in Defense of Robust Debate About the History and Meaning of the War in Israel/Gaza”.

“We write now to express grave concerns about how some of our students are being viciously targeted with doxing, public shaming, surveillance by members of our community, including other students, and reprisals from employers,” the professors wrote. These “efforts to chill otherwise protected speech on campus are unacceptable”.

Although the letter noted that “armed resistance by an occupied people must conform to the laws of war, which include a prohibition against the intentional targeting of civilians”, it did not mention Hamas by name, or its tactics, and described Hamas’s attack as a “military action”. It characterized “the events of October 7 … [as] a military response by a people who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power over many years”, and as “just one salvo in an ongoing war between an occupying state and the people it occupies”.

One signatory, the sociology professor Joseph Massad, had published a piece in the online publication the Electronic Intifada the day after the attack, asking if it marked “the start of the Palestinian War of Liberation or yet another battle in the interminable struggle between the colonizer and the colonized”. The article described the massacre as an “awesome” spectacle and referred to Israelis killed, many of them leftwing kibbutzniks, as “settler-colonists”. He also referred to a “horrifying human toll on all sides”. Students upset with his language organized a petition calling for Massad’s firing that has more than 70,000 signatures.

Next, another group of faculty members published a counter-letter on “the Campus Conversation About Hamas’s Atrocities and the War in Israel and Gaza”.

“We feel sorrow for all civilians who are killed or suffering in this war, including so many in Gaza,” the signatories wrote. “Yet whatever one thinks of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or of Israeli policies, Hamas’s genocidal massacre was an act of terror and cannot be justified, or its true purpose obscured with euphemisms and oblique references. We ask the entire University community to condemn the Hamas attack unambiguously.”

Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Arab studies and noted advocate for Palestinian rights, was one of the signatories of the earlier, pro-Palestinian letter. He told me that the letter should be understood as existing in an atmosphere, at Columbia and in the US more largely, that is overwhelmingly hostile to critiques of Israel. He also feels that the second faculty letter mischaracterized the first as a defense of killing civilians.

“Could it have been worded differently? Yes,” Khalidi said. “Should it have been worded differently? Perhaps.” But the letter was a joint effort “drafted hastily” to defend the students, and “anybody who sees it as a reasoned political manifesto is entirely missing the point”.

In an emailed statement, Jack Halberstam, a gender studies professor who also signed the pro-Palestinian letter, told me: “I signed the letter in solidarity with the call for protected speech for students on campus and to resist the idea that all critiques of Israel are antisemitic. The letter was clear in its condemnation of the killing and torture of civilians by Hamas but it also drew attention to the larger context out of which this violence emerges.”

Halberstam added: “I have received some very ugly emails since signing the faculty letter and I am appalled by the vitriol that generates such emails. These emails label me a ‘self-hating Jew’ and tell me that Hamas would not hesitate to kill me given that I am transgender. The tenor of these emails is appalling.”

Matthew Waxman, a law professor who signed the pro-Israel counter-letter, told me that it was motivated by a sense that antisemitism wasn’t taken seriously: “This is not to distract from other terrible types of campus discrimination that of course must be combatted, but many Jewish and Israeli members of the university community face palpable antisemitism and rhetoric that would not be tolerated if directed at other groups.”

The sociologist Jonathan Rieder, who also signed the counter-letter, told me that what really troubled him was a seeming refusal to acknowledge the reality of Hamas and its actions.

“As a person of the liberal left and an academic, I am puzzled by the appalling silence of quote-unquote progressives in the face of the worst genocidal antisemitic attack since the Holocaust. It doesn’t matter if you’re left or right. It applies to all of us who would like to see an end to the occupation. As a practical matter, that silence will hurt the movement to end the occupation and forge a broad democratic movement. It undercuts what a humanistic left should be doing to end suffering on all sides.”

A number of American universities have recently been the sites of acrimonious debate and ugly viral episodes related to the Gaza war. A Muslim student at Stanford was hospitalized following a hit-and-run, which is being investigated as a possible hate crime. At New York University, students were filmed ripping down posters of Israeli hostages and an NYU law student had a job offer rescinded after posting a statement blaming Israel for the 7 October attacks. Jewish students at Cooper Union released a film that they said showed them locked in a library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian protesters banged on doors and windows. A student at Cornell was arrested last week for threatening a shooting and rape spree against Jewish students.

Columbia, however, has had a particularly long history as a fulcrum of debate about Israel and Palestine. Edward Said, one of the world’s most famous Palestinian scholars and activists, taught there for many years, and Rashid Khalidi holds a professorship named for Said. Many students and faculty have called on Columbia in recent years to divest from Israel and cease curricular programs there, though the university has resisted.

Last week, Columbia’s president announced the creation of a taskforce to investigate antisemitism on campus. A similar announcement at Barnard also cited Islamophobia; Columbia did not, though it announced the creation of a “doxing resource group” to help students who had been harassed for their pro-Palestinian views.

Columbia has also canceled its annual “Giving Day” fundraising event. A spokesperson said that the university had decided “this is not the appropriate time to move forward”."

Alicia Kearns, the chair of the committee, which will start holding evidence sessions on the issue in November, has been one of the most prominent MPs warning that a crisis was brewing that required greater attention and a more robust approach from the UK towards Israel’s new government.

Critics argue that the UK government, along with others, missed the danger signals and invested in an unconditional and one-sided relationship with Israel that did not acknowledge how different the government elected in November was to its predecessors.

Kearns said it was ridiculous – and symbolic – when the Foreign Office abolished the now-restored post of Middle East minister in 2022. “There is a chance that we might be seeing a third intifada and the Gaza crisis of 2023. We should be worried, because what happens in Palestine and Israel impacts around the world,” she told MPs in July as she called for Rishi Sunak to appoint a Middle East peace envoy following an Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. “I stress that this low-commitment ask would allow us to live up to our responsibilities and demonstrate meaningful resolve. Our voice is unique and will be heard, and we have a role to play in the peace process.”

In an evidence session in March with the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton, she asked: “Do you think we have the right posture towards Israel? I, for my part, feel that we have failed to be a critical friend. We have a very close and important security friendship but we have yet to adopt that critical one,” adding that she found the agenda of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government concerning.

“If I am honest, it feels increasingly to me that the reason we are silent around the Middle East is because there is no Instagram diplomacy to be won. There are no easy wins,” she said.

Her remarks to the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office came six days after the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and his Israeli counterpart, Eli Cohen, issued a 2030 roadmap deepening cooperation across the breadth of the Israel-UK relationship, including on trade, cyber-security, research and development, security, health, climate and gender. It made no reference to the two-state solution, simply promising to help Palestinian economic development. The timing of the roadmap’s publication was striking in that Israel was in turmoil over Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul. When Netanyahu came to London a few days later, Sunak avoided a joint Downing Street press event with his Israeli counterpart.

Relations between the Conservative party and Israel have always been warm, but Israel historically felt those relations had been held back by Foreign Office so-called Arabists.

Just before the 7 October Hamas attacks, Mark Regev, a former Israeli ambassador to London and currently Netanyahu’s adviser, felt moved to write a piece in the Jerusalem Post hailing the end of the influence of Arabists in the Foreign Office, those who have devoted their careers to the Middle East.

“For over a half century, Israeli diplomats working in London complained about the legendary antipathy of the Foreign Office’s Arabists,” he wrote. Unlike other specialists – Sinologists, Russologists, and Africa experts – Arabists were accused of having an infatuation with their interlocutors, of seeing Arab and British interests as intrinsically linked, and of viewing Israel through a hostile prism.

Regev said the change had its roots in Arab states themselves. “London’s most important Arab partners, especially those in the Gulf, no longer perceive Israel as an enemy; instead, the pragmatic Arab states increasingly view Israel as a partner and an ally. Even the most diehard British Arabist has trouble remaining more negative about Israel than the Arabs themselves.”

He continued: “If in the past the composition of a UK ambassador in Israel’s job was 80% Arab-Israel conflict-related and 20% bilateral ties, these proportions have now flipped. Today the focus is predominantly on building stronger, mutually beneficial Israel-UK cooperation – which, according to London’s most recent figures, has seen trade reach £7.3bn, up 29.9% from 12 months ago.”

Faced with the charge that he had pursued trade deals above Middle East peace, Cleverly has said he has repeatedly expressed concern on behalf of the government, in public and private, about the expansion of Israeli settlements.

But challenged in June by the foreign affairs committee member Neil Coyle about whether this concern was pro-forma, asking “what actions you are taking against those who are pursuing the expansion and annexation of settlements”, Cleverly replied: “You say that we are seeing no action, but I have made the point that on a number of occasions there have been well-advanced talks through diplomacy.”

Cleverly continued: “Through diplomacy, we have prevented those expansions from happening … we do not get our way in every instance, but that is how diplomacy works.”

UN evidence hardly supports Cleverly’s claim the UK has prevented expansions from happening. The UN estimates that 670,000 Israeli citizens live in 130 illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and this year had already set an all-time record for settlement construction in the West Bank. Since January, Israel has advanced 12,855 settler housing units across the West Bank, according to the NGO Peace Now – the highest number the group has recorded since it started tracking such activity in 2012.

Arguably, the only practical step the Sunak government has taken is to propose a law to prevent UK public bodies from divesting in Israel. The economic activity of public bodies (overseas matter) bill last week had its report stage, when former Conservative ministers such as George Eustice expressed misgivings at its foreign policy implications.

Many Conservative MPs have pointed out the British government’s position over a long period of time has been that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are illegal. But Eustice feared the wording in the bill was designed to send signals that this was changing. Kearns said she had spent hours on the phone with Arab ambassadors, including those who support normalisation with Israel, who wanted to know whether this meant post-1967 Israeli settlements were still regarded as illegal by the UK government.

One former UK ambassador argues Cleverly’s visit to Israel in September was a missed chance to criticise illegal settlements, and the threat they pose to the survival of two-state solution. In a long speech on 12 September to a counter-terrorism conference in Herzliya, Israel, Cleverly did made a clear call for both sides to make a commitment to a two-state solution, but then referenced the “so many wonderful, positive developments in this region” by which he meant normalisation between Arab states and Israel.

Faced with the reality of ever more illegal settlements, he provided £1.5m to help the victims of settler violence and in his speech said he commended “Israel’s taking of legal action against those settlers who have perpetrated violence”. One former diplomat said: “Charitably, one can say he was encouraging those in Netanyahu’s government that want to prosecute settler violence, but to say it is happening is pure wish fulfilment.” In June, Netanyahu had given control of settlement planning in the West Bank to the firebrand finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.

“It is very hard to find a front rank Tory politician that is willing to criticise Israel about anything,” said Chris Doyle, from the Council for Arab-British Understanding. “The government acts as if Israel is in favour of a two-state solution, but the Israeli government coalition formally opposes it. Ministers never call them out on this.”

Arab diplomats in London say they feel excluded from the Foreign Office, saying normalisation with Israel was too often seen by UK ministers as an alternative, not an adjunct, to the Palestinian issue. Onesaid: “The UK is giving Israel a licence to kill.”

Some feel also the government is playing domestic politics with the issue, trying to create fractures inside the Labour party rather than working out what is the best position to adopt peace. “If Rishi Sunak had called for an end to the siege, I am pretty sure Keir Starmer could as well.” But none are suggesting the planned Gulf-UK free trade deal is in jeopardy.

Calls are still being made for Sunak to signal new energy on the Palestinian issue by appointing either Lord Hague, a former foreign secretary, or Alistair Burt, a respected former Middle East minister, as special envoy. Hague, busy elsewhere, is unlikely to want the job while Burt, a pro-European, would be a hard sell in today’s Tory party.

Those who know Cleverly well say he is deeply horrified by the loss of life, but shares Israel’s desire to see Hamas politically destroyed so it cannot regroup to repeat its barbarity. He has already commissioned work on the “day after” administration in Gaza and is deeply engaged diplomatically.

If he is rushing to catch up, he is not alone among European leaders. But the inquiry may prove uncomfortable if the Foreign Office is asked to show how Britain’s declared proximity to Israel was used to secure peace, and not just profit."

The Guardian Essential poll of 1,150 voters, released on Tuesday, also found that Anthony Albanese’s approval rating is now negative for the first time in his prime ministership.

Asked what Australia should do in “the current conflict in Israel and Palestine”, about 21% said provide “active support” to Palestine, up eight points since October, while 17% said to do so for Israel, down six points.

About two-thirds of voters are concerned about the risk of escalation globally (66%) or hostilities between Palestinian and Israeli communities at home (63%).

Approximately 35% described Israel’s response as “proportionate”, down seven points since October, the month of the Hamas attack that Israel estimates to have killed 1,200.

More than 10,800 people have now been killed in Gaza, almost 70% of them women and children. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has called for “steps towards” a ceasefire including for Hamas to release hostages and for Israel to stop attacking hospitals.

A New York civil liberties group has launched a lawsuit accusing the US government of failing in its duty to prevent Israel committing genocide in Gaza.
“We reject the claim that the Australian Jewish community unanimously supports the actions of the Israeli government,” the letter said.";"A United Nations expert has met with a senior member of the Australian government and urged it to stop giving “leeway” to Israel, arguing Australia has a responsibility to “prevent atrocity crimes” including genocide.

Francesca Albanese held talks with the assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, on Wednesday and expressed her concern “as strongly as she could” about what she saw as Australia’s inadequate response to the escalating bloodshed in Gaza.

In an interview with Guardian Australia after the meeting, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories said the government’s reluctance to openly criticise Israel was “not only unacceptable – it’s dangerous”.

“It just gives leeway to continuing these operations, [whereas] I think that if Israel is isolated in its stance it will be more difficult for Israel to continue this heavy bombardment of Gaza, which has killed so many,” she said at Parliament House.

Far from being a bystander on the other side of the world, Albanese said, Australia had its own responsibility under international law to join efforts to prevent war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

“Australia should be consistent and coherent with its international law obligations,” the Italian lawyer said.

“The grave risk [of genocide] is there. And genocide, like other atrocity crimes, [is] not just there to be addressed through international tribunals once [it has] happened; [it should] be prevented.

“This is why we have these important conventions, and I don’t see, frankly, a robust engagement to prevent atrocity crimes.”

Albanese welcomed the meeting and believed Watts had “a pragmatic grasp of the situation”, although she was unsure whether the government would “embrace a paradigm shift premised upon international law”.

Albanese has previously been accused by Israel of bias, a charge she denies. The Israeli government has long demanded Albanese’s dismissal and refused to cooperate with her, contending that her language was symptomatic of an anti-Israeli mindset that underplayed the country’s legitimate security concerns.

The Israeli embassy in Canberra declined to comment on Wednesday, but the country’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said last month: “Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation … Hamas has only one goal – to annihilate Israel.”

The international criminal court is investigating both Israel and Hamas for alleged war crimes, but legal scholars say genocide is a harder crime to prove.

The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines it as covering acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.

The convention’s first article requires signatories, which include Australia and the US, “to prevent and to punish” genocide. A New York civil liberties group has launched a lawsuit accusing the US government of failing in its duty to prevent Israel committing genocide in Gaza.

Albanese said that at this stage, “many of us do not feel capable of being conclusive” about whether Israel’s actions met the intent threshold, but she reiterated that Palestinians were at “grave risk” of genocide.

She said the Australian government – which has called for adherence to international law and has said the world will not accept continuing civilian deaths – should be “bolder”.

Albanese described the people of Gaza as “running from one place to another, with their kids in their arms and nothing left, trying not to be killed”.

Drawing parallels between the polarised debate in Australia and in her home country of Italy, Albanese said she “would love not to see this sort of football match situation [between] the pro-Palestinians and the pro-Israelis”, because people on both sides were “suffering tremendously”.

“We are all human beings, and should be able to recognise both the trauma and the pain and the legitimate aspirations to have rights recognised and respected,” she said.

“Both the Israelis and the Palestinians have those rights, so it shouldn’t be a zero-sum game.”

A number of prominent Jewish groups in Australia have rejected calls for a ceasefire, arguing that would amount to a victory for Hamas, which killed about 1,200 people in its attacks in southern Israel on 7 October and took more than 200 others hostage.

But more than 800 Jewish Australians have now signed an open letter urging the government to “call now for both the release of innocent hostages, and for a full ceasefire”.

“We reject the claim that the Australian Jewish community unanimously supports the actions of the Israeli government,” the letter said.

A spokesperson for Jewish Australians for a ceasefire said there was “a loud and growing chorus of Jews around the world who desperately want a ceasefire”.

“Jews are not a monolith,” the spokesperson said.

“There are tectonic shifts under way in Jewish communities worldwide on this issue, especially among younger Jews.”

It depicts a growing movement of Jews, many of them young, who want to support Palestinian rights and lessen Israel’s centrality to American Jewish identity.
“In the reform and conservative Jewish movement, Israel is sort of always introduced as almost like a Jewish Disneyland, this place where Jews can be fully Jews,” he said.
It shows how Hillel, the Jewish campus organization active in most colleges in the US, pushes Jewish students towards pro-Israel advocacy, with ex-IDF soldiers attending meetings of students.";"Erin Axelman was a fervent Zionist by the time they reached high school in the late 2000s. For their bat mitzvah, they had received a copy of Exodus by Leon Uris. The 1958 novel, one of the bestselling books of the decade, tells a story about the creation of the Israeli state that helped cement American Zionism. “It’s this kind of heroic, almost mythical tale of the creation of the state of Israel and it was incredibly empowering,” Axelman said.

After reading Exodus, Axelman “became obsessed with Israel”, they said. “I considered joining the Israeli military and fantasized about moving there.” They latched on to the story of Jews returning home.

Then in high school, a teacher, taking note of Axelman’s enthusiasm, suggested they read about the history of Palestine. It proved a wake-up call. “The narratives I’d learned up to that point only mentioned Palestinians in passing or as an obstacle,” said Axelman. “But I read for an entire year Palestinian historians like Rashid Khalidi and leftwing Israeli historians like Tom Segev.” They say the process reminded them of what they’d learned in school about the history of the US, “in terms of a people who came to a new country that were refugees or immigrants and created a city on a hill, a beacon of light and a democracy. That narrative is incredibly empowering until you hear about the Native Americans and you realize it lacks some really basic points.”

That change in perception was the inspiration for the documentary Israelism, which Axelman directed with Sam Eilertsen. The film argues that some American Jews are told a story – about Jews escaping persecution and genocide to return to their ancestral homeland – that almost entirely erases the existence of Palestinians. It’s a narrative that has been incredibly influential in shaping global attitudes about the Israeli state and US alliances in the Middle East.

The film focuses on the lives of two young American Jews – Simone Zimmerman, who went to a Jewish school and lived in Israel on an exchange program, and Eitan (who doesn’t use his last name), who joined the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) after graduating high school. Zimmerman describes what she went through as a system of “indoctrination” and “mass mobilization” to turn her into an advocate for Israel within the US. It depicts a system of education and advocacy that demands pro-Israeli activism of some young Jewish Americans. There’s particular focus on what’s taught by the Birthright Israel Foundation on the free trips it organises to Israel for Jews living around the world that are part-funded by the Israeli government.

The film shows American Jewish children in elementary school waving Israeli flags and chanting: “We wanna go! We wanna go!” At a private Jewish middle school, children are filmed reading Alan Dershowitz’s The Case for Israel, and at Birthright “mega events” in Jerusalem thousands of American teenagers are filmed cheering the IDF as a speaker tells them: “It’s up to you to be our soldiers abroad … ready to sway public opinion in Israel’s favor.”

All the subjects of the documentary go through a transformation, in many cases meeting with Palestinians and visiting the West Bank. It depicts a growing movement of Jews, many of them young, who want to support Palestinian rights and lessen Israel’s centrality to American Jewish identity.

The documentary was made before the 7 October Hamas terrorist attack in Israel and subsequent bombing of Gaza. But demand for the film has soared in the past few weeks. The film-makers are now holding weekly virtual screenings as well as a major tour of the US and Europe that is selling out. “People say to us: ‘I want to show my family this film, to help them understand,’” Axelman said.

The duo say promoting the film in the wake of the 7 October attacks has been difficult. “When I first went to Israel-Palestine when I was 21, I volunteered at this hostel with this amazing Israeli guy who does anti-occupation work and runs this hostel with Palestinian folks,” said Axelman. “Both of his parents were murdered by Hamas, and seeing the pain on his face in interviews is unbearable. It’s been obviously a very difficult time for our team – many folks have lost people, or are terrified that they’re going to lose people.”

Axelman says that their film helps explain that complexity of feeling now – that it’s impossible to understand the lenses through which people view the conflict without understanding the stories they’ve been told. “If you think of Israel as totally the land of the Jewish people, it seems like a very straightforward narrative that Hamas committed an isolated incident of pure evil terrorism,” Axelman said. “It’s true that Hamas murdered innocent civilians on a mass scale that is unbelievably traumatizing for Jewish people. It’s also true that happened in the context of brutal occupation that has existed for the entirety of most Palestinians’ lives.”

Axelman grew up in a small Jewish community in rural Maine. Their parents were hippies, of the same generation as Bernie Sanders. Axelman and their brother were the only self-identifying Jewish kids at their high school. “We got made fun of, it made us feel very different,” they said. “It was difficult to formulate a positive Jewish identity, feeling like an outsider and processing the horrors of the Holocaust and the horrors of antisemitism as a young person.”

Learning about Israel was a salve. “It’s true we do have an incredible ancient history there and so it makes sense, from a very basic standpoint, that it has a lot of emotional resonance. Because it is true we needed to escape Europe.”

Eilertsen, the film’s other director, experienced similar depictions of Israel growing up. “In the reform and conservative Jewish movement, Israel is sort of always introduced as almost like a Jewish Disneyland, this place where Jews can be fully Jews,” he said.

By the time they got to Brown University, Axelman was meeting other young people who “had been taught to love Israel unconditionally” but changed their views after coming into contact with Palestinians and hearing their stories.

They remember the leader of Brown Students for Israel, “who would essentially harass Palestinian students, and went to work for the ADL after college”, referring to the staunchly pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League. A decade later, Axelman says, those same students are doing Palestinian human rights work. “Seeing so many of these pro-Israel student leaders go through this transformation made me really interested in making this film.”

The film also argues that in some American Jewish communities, cultural celebration of Israel is channeled into high-stakes political activism. It shows how Hillel, the Jewish campus organization active in most colleges in the US, pushes Jewish students towards pro-Israel advocacy, with ex-IDF soldiers attending meetings of students. One interviewee, Sarah Anne Minkin, the director of programs at the Foundation for Middle East Peace, describes a set of institutions that turn “young Jews into soldiers for Israel”.

One of the main ways this happens, the film says, is through the pro-Israel lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac).

“This energy and this education quickly turns into actual political lobbying for Israel. We film people who, in Jewish high school, were sent to Aipac conferences to do lobbying. And in that lobbying, the most important thing is Israel is depoliticized. Supporting Israel is presented as this emotional state; it’s just something you’re supposed to do. And criticizing it is simply antisemitism,” Eilertsen said.

The directors point to Aipac’s unwavering support for Donald Trump, even as he refused to condemn antisemitic white nationalists, as evidence of the way the organization prioritizes support for Israel over other interests.

Zimmerman, whose high school sent her to Aipac conferences, says it was just a normal part of her life. “That’s part of the indoctrination, to tell young Jewish people they have to be soldiers in the battles to defend Israel, whether it’s on the ground or on the battleground of public opinion,” she said.

Zimmerman and the film-makers stress that the US has myriad strategic interests in the Middle East that are separate from the Israel lobby. “It’s about these countries’ foreign policy – but they use the narrative about protecting Jews conveniently as an excuse to justify other aspects of their foreign policy,” she said.

The film-makers are precise in their criticism of Aipac, and stress that it does not represent all American Jews, a diverse community that includes anti-Zionists and people with no connection to Israel. “​When people start making exaggerated claims about the power that Aipac actually has, that can slide into antisemitism,” said Eilertsen. “But the reality is that Aipac and aligned groups like Democratic Majority for Israel do have a lot of influence on Capitol Hill and they are widely credited” with helping elect candidates of their choice and defeat others they deem insufficiently supportive of Israel, he said. “These are facts, not conspiracy theories, so the idea that it’s antisemitic to say they have influence on our politics is an absurd deflection.”

Not everyone agrees. Writing in the Jewish Journal, an LA-based weekly, the columnist David Suissa said Israelism “wants us to believe that Zionist advocacy was so one-sided and all-consuming it created a generation of young Jews who, feeling duped, have turned against the Jewish state”. A board member of the UCLA branch of Students Supporting Israel, a Zionist group, told the Jewish Journal she felt the film was “extremely problematic” and “full of propaganda”.

The directors acknowledge there are people who come to the screenings who don’t agree with the premise of the film and ask critical questions. They encourage this, they say. But there hadn’t “been a single screening where someone hasn’t come up to us and said: ‘This is my story too,’” says Eilertsen.

They point too to the film’s hopeful tone, showing how through campus life, more open discussion and the Jewish left, many young Jews have a more evolved position on Israel. It shows a mass sit-in at the headquarters of the Birthright foundation, with Jewish protesters demanding a more honest dialogue.

“If there’s anything that gives me even a drop of hope in this horrific time, it’s that more people are going to take the blinders off,” said Zimmerman. “That people are going to stop believing the lies we were taught and have the courage to face the reality of Israel and not the fantasy of it.”

It said: The Hostages and Missing Families Forum vehemently condemns Minister Eliyahu’s concerning statement. International law, along with fundamental principles of human morality and common sense, strictly prohibits the use of mass destruction weapons. The Forum underscores that the utmost priority for Israel’s actions in Gaza must be the release of hostages held by Hamas, including women, children, infants, and the elderly. Such a reckless and cruel statement, which does not represent the official position of the State of Israel or the families of the hostages, should never have been made.

His remarks found echoes in Qatar, the country mediating between Hamas and Israel, which said a period of calm was needed to release hostages. The US official briefing on Saturday said: “We are now speaking about a very significant pause in the fighting to get the hostages out.” It is the first time the US government has spoken about a lengthy pause and goes some way to narrow the gap between the US and those Arab states calling for a full ceasefire. The senior White House official said: “Any arrangement to get 200 hostages out of Gaza is going to require a fairly significant pause in hostilities. And the framework being discussed, should we get to that point, that would obviously go into place. And I think that is something that the president is briefed on regularly. “And so, should that get into place, there would be a very significant pause in hostilities to make sure that that arrangement can actually be implemented. The official added: “And the numbers that we’re talking about, it would take a very significant pause in the conflict, in the fighting to be able to do this.”

Outside al-Shifa, displaced woman Haneed Abdelhakim Saad said her family would not leave Gaza City despite the Israeli demands for civilians to go. She fears that if they head to the south they will never be allowed back home. “They can cut off the water, the electricity, the food but we are staying,” she said. “This is what we want: to live in peace, to have our children go out without worrying about them.” In the south, where Israel has ordered all Gaza civilians to go, saying this would be for their own safety, hundreds of thousands of displaced people, many now living in makeshift shelters, also endured a night of heavy bombardment under a communications blackout.

In two ways, the repercussions of the war in Gaza will be beyond the power of any outside state to control.
The repercussions of an ongoing war in Gaza will therefore work themselves out over many months and years.";"At first sight, it looks almost inevitable that the war in Gaza will spread. Quite apart from the anger it has caused in the Muslim world, China and still more Russia would seem to have every incentive to cause trouble for the United States – and, as has been demonstrated again and again over the years, the Middle East is the greatest area of US vulnerability.

On closer examination, things do not look so simple. In the first place, if Moscow and Beijing are content with a purely diplomatic and public relations victory, they do not need to do anything at all. US virtual silence in the face of Israel’s indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza is doing it for them. Yet again, the United States has used its UN security council veto to defend Israel, as the solitary opponent both of all the other UNSC members, and a large majority of the general assembly. As western (and some US) diplomats have remarked (off the record), unfaltering US support for Israel has shredded the Biden administration’s strategy of competing with China for influence in the “global south”.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the western reaction to it, the charge has been made across most of the non-western world (including by US partners like India) that the west has one standard for white victims, and a much lower one for everyone else. The Biden administration (and many European governments) have now in effect confirmed this.

Witness (in a widely circulated clip) the US national security council spokesperson John Kirby choking back crocodile tears over Russian bombardment of civilians in Ukraine, then justifying Israeli “collateral damage” in Gaza – although according to UN figures, Israel has already killed almost as many Palestinian civilians in two weeks as Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in 20 months. Equally striking has been the refusal of the Biden administration to do anything to help the 500-600 Palestinian American US citizens trapped in Gaza. If anyone wants evidence to argue that in the eyes of Washington some US citizens are more equal than others, they need look no further than this.

Dependence on imported oil also gives China a strong incentive not to try to extend the Gaza conflict across the Middle East. Especially given its present economic troubles, China cannot afford the shock to the world economy that would result from a massive and prolonged surge in oil prices. China has used the Ukraine war and western sanctions to drive some very advantageous energy deals with Russia, but Moscow is nowhere near being able to compensate for Chinese energy supplies from the Persian Gulf.

Moreover, given their own restive Muslim regions, both Russia and China fear the spread of Sunni extremism. This may well happen anyway, but Moscow and Beijing will not help the process. Fear of Sunni jihadi movements was a key reason for Russia’s intervention in the Syrian civil war, where many Chechens and other Muslim volunteers were fighting for the Islamic State.

In Syria, Russian forces fought alongside Iranian revolutionary guards and Hezbollah. Since the invasion of Ukraine has faltered, Russia and Iran have forged a closer partnership, and Russia has come to increasingly depend on Iran for supplies of drones. On the other hand, Russia is in a position to give extremely important help to Iran in the areas of missile technology and satellite intelligence.

That does not mean that Iran will launch itself into an appallingly risky war with the United States at Russia’s behest, nor that Hezbollah will launch such a war against Israel at Iran’s behest – though it is easy to imagine how the clashes occurring on the Lebanese-Israeli border could escalate to full-scale war.

One thing does nonetheless seem certain: that if hawks in Israel and the US manage to exploit this crisis to bring about a US attack on Iran (as many of the very same people 20 years ago used 9/11 to bring about a US attack on Iraq), then Russia at least will do its utmost to arm Iran. For Russia, such a strategy would be irresistible, given US and Nato arming of Ukraine. Attacks by Iranian-backed Shia militias on US troops in Iraq, if they manage to cause significant casualties, could give these hawks a casus belli.

In two ways, the repercussions of the war in Gaza will be beyond the power of any outside state to control. The first is the reaction of the Arab masses – whom, as the Arab spring of 2011 demonstrated, cannot safely be ignored. It is impossible to judge just how endangered the regimes in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are at present; but their differing vulnerabilities are obvious.

Second, there is the likely spread of terrorism. Tens of thousands of US and European citizens working in the Gulf are acutely vulnerable to attack, if only by infuriated lone wolves. Their flight would in turn have a severe effect on the local economies, potentially worsening mass discontent.

Above all, there is the dire threat of a new wave of terrorism in Europe (which has indeed already begun on a small scale) as a result of Europe’s refusal to support a ceasefire in Gaza. Given Russia’s own experience of terrorism, there is no reason to think it would support such terrorism, but it could bring Russia considerable benefits.

Increased Islamist terrorism would almost certainly drive still further anti-immigrant sentiment and support for rightwing parties in Europe, which are already surging in the polls. As a result of the invasion of Ukraine, these have mostly reduced (in public at least) their traditional sympathy for Russia; but their overwhelming focus on immigration in itself would reduce their commitment to Ukraine. Moreover, the ascent to power of populist rightwing movements in western Europe would deepen divisions within the European Union and leave Germany isolated.

The repercussions of an ongoing war in Gaza will therefore work themselves out over many months and years. It is hard to see how any of them will be to the advantage of the United States or Europe."

However, the Israeli left is not without its share of responsibility.
On and on until the ultimate destruction, before, finally, sanctuary arrived with the 1947 UN decision to partition Palestine and create a refuge for Holocaust survivors.
But 7 million Jews and 7 million Palestinians are not going to go away.
Jon Lansman is a co-founder and former chair of MomentumDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?";"To speak out as a leftwing Jew on any aspect of this century-old conflict is to risk isolation and hate from both sides. That much I know, having directed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaigns and called out the antisemitism of that period. So, on 8 October, absorbing the emerging details of the Hamas massacre the previous day, I feared the consequence of speaking out again.

It turned out that in such circumstances I could not have been in a more supportive place during the Labour party conference than at a joint-faith meeting organised by a Jewish and Muslim women’s group in a Liverpool synagogue. Grief shared in such a setting was great comfort and some relief for all of us together – Muslims and Jews.

It used not to be difficult to support both peoples who live in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as I did, by distinguishing their needs and aspirations from those of their leaders. But the rise to power of former rightwing terrorists Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir to the highest office in Israel was where a supremacist philosophy began to take hold in the politics of Israeli Jews. It appealed, as far-right politics always do, to those who felt let down or ignored by their governments, as Mizrahi Jews (of Middle Eastern or north African heritage) and more religious Jews did by the secular Ashkenazi (European) Israeli Labor Party establishment.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza also began to lose trust in their leaders from Fatah and the Palestinian Authority who were seen as self-serving, even corrupt – a shift that benefited more religious candidates and Hamas. Tensions increased within and between both communities.

However, the Israeli left is not without its share of responsibility. In Israel’s prehistory, those who led the Jewish government-in-waiting before the state’s establishment observed the Holocaust from British-administered Palestine. Their attitude to the 6 million murdered and the 1 million survivors who found their way to Israel can be characterised by the phrase they used to describe the manner of their deaths: “They went like sheep to the slaughter.” A contempt for weakness was embedded in the Israeli left, which now in the hands of its far-right successors, has created a culture of permanent war that is supremacist and authoritarian towards Palestinians. A culture mirrored by Hamas.

And so, in the war that was certain to follow the Hamas attacks, how can a leftwing Jew best maintain support for both peoples when your family, friends and comrades take opposing sides?

These two peoples are crammed into a tiny space in the former British mandate of Palestine, about 7 million of each. Each of them astonishingly resilient after almost a century of conflict. Wars. Terrorism on both sides. Shoah and Nakba. Pogroms and “transfer”. And each side with leaders they would do better without. Benjamin Netanyahu and Ismail Haniyeh. Lions led by donkeys.

I immersed myself at an early age in the history of centuries of Jewish suffering. Expulsion from England in 1290, from Spain in 1492 alongside the Muslims. On and on until the ultimate destruction, before, finally, sanctuary arrived with the 1947 UN decision to partition Palestine and create a refuge for Holocaust survivors. In the UK, Labour’s conference had supported partition, especially the left. The Attlee government ignored the conference – some things don’t change. It resisted partition, pleading its duties as the mandate authority.

I do not accept the official narrative curiously shared by both Zionists and anti-Zionists that Israel was created because of a chain of events from Theodor Herzl’s inspiration through to Balfour’s declaration and the UN partition. It was driven more by guilt than principle: no one would take the Holocaust refugees, and there was no other option. To have the Holocaust now often thrust in your face by people on the left as a reason for your failure to have “the right line” on Israel (whatever that means) is hard to take.

In the 1960s, the left backed Israel. Aged 10 in 1967, I cut out news stories each day of the six-day war. In 1973, Israel, caught off guard by Egyptian and Syrian forces in the Yom Kippur war, was again the underdog, supported in Britain by the Labour opposition but not by the Heath government. The fact that Israel was still being attacked by its neighbours 25 years after it was established as a refuge for Holocaust survivors is the root of my sympathy for the Jews of Israel/Palestine, the people, but not necessarily for their government.

History itself is a weapon in the present. My generation remembers when Israel was led by the left and supported by the left elsewhere. My children’s generation see an Israel where there is not a sizeable left to speak of.

I might have no religious faith and I do not believe that the land was given to Jews by anyone other than the UN, but I celebrate the same festivals they do and eat the same food. I still feel an affinity I cannot explain.

There is no military solution to this conflict. But 7 million Jews and 7 million Palestinians are not going to go away. They need leaders who will work for peace, and bring Palestinians and Israelis together. There can be no role for those who want perpetual war.

Its already tattered political credibility with its people, many of whom regard it as not only corrupt but as a security contractor for the Israeli state, would be nonexistent.
Mohammed Dahlan, sometimes cited as a possible, if controversial, future leader of the Palestinians, also laid out a postwar path to a future state this week.";"For Palestinians in Gaza, life is endured moment to moment, not knowing whether there will be food for their children’s next meal, or clean water for an ailing parent, or – with the death toll now having reached at least 8,796, according to the Gaza health ministry – whether their family will even survive the day.

Israel, however, must look ahead to address what will happen in Gaza “the day after” the war with Hamas. The devastation and need will be almost unimaginable. Though the ground offensive is under way, Benjamin Netanyahu does not have an endgame for this conflict, the extension of which may extend his own tenure as prime minister. Unless Israel can offer such a plan, US patience is likely to run out.

After the atrocities of 7 October, when Hamas killed at least 1,400 Israelis and others, control of Gaza by whatever of the group survives will not be tolerated again. But as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told a Senate panel on Tuesday: “We also can’t have – and the Israelis start with this proposition themselves – Israel running or controlling Gaza.”

Instead, Israel is floating implausible ideas. Mr Netanyahu reportedly sought to convince European leaders to pressure Egypt to accept refugees, at least temporarily: an old idea given new life. An Israeli thinktank led by former officials published (then deleted) a paper recommending the “unique and rare opportunity to evacuate the whole Gaza Strip”; a leaked report from an Israeli government research body reportedly advocated the forcible and permanent transfer of all 2.2 million inhabitants. Cairo has been absolutely clear that this is a non-starter, not least because all foresee that Palestinians are unlikely to be able to return.

Nor is there enthusiasm for another idea reportedly explored by the US and Israel, which would see regional powers take control temporarily, backed up by a multinational force, possibly including US and British troops. It is hard to see western leaders opting to put their personnel in harm’s way. More plausible might be an Arab peacekeeping force, funded by Riyadh. The UAE has stressed that it is not pulling back from its normalisation of ties with Israel, and the White House says that Saudi Arabia is still open to a deal. But politically, they could not sign up without a proper deal for Palestinians.

All this leads to the Palestinian Authority, whose prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, told the Guardian that it would not run Gaza without a solution for the West Bank. Its already tattered political credibility with its people, many of whom regard it as not only corrupt but as a security contractor for the Israeli state, would be nonexistent.

The relentless expansion and entrenchment of settlements led even many ardent supporters of the two-state solution to conclude that it was no longer feasible. Now it is clear that sweeping it off the table also failed. If the repeated invocation of the two-state solution by western leaders in recent days was partly intended to deflect criticism of their failure to condemn the enormous civilian toll of Israel’s offensive, it also reflects a growing sense that there is no longer a choice. Mohammed Dahlan, sometimes cited as a possible, if controversial, future leader of the Palestinians, also laid out a postwar path to a future state this week. The terrain could not, however, be less promising or more treacherous. It is clear that it cannot be crossed under the current political leadership."

Releasing footage which it claims shows a fighter armed with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, in a message posted on the Telegram messaging app, the IDF said: RPG fire and small arms fire were directed at the soldiers from the direction of the al-Quds hospital in Gaza City. The shooting was carried out by a terrorist squad that had embedded itself within a group of civilians at the entrance of the hospital. The soldiers identified a terrorist squad with two RPG launchers amongst the civilians. As a result of the shooting carried out by the terrorists, a tank was damaged. The soldiers fired toward the terrorists. During the exchange of fire, civilians were seen leaving the hospital building, and other terrorists who came out of adjacent buildings hid among them and joined the attempted attack. After the terrorists fired RPGs, they returned to hide in the hospital. The IDF claims that in the incident it killed “approximately 21 terrorists” and that there were no Israeli casualties. The statement went on to say “This incident is another example of Hamas’s continued abuse of civilian structures, including hospitals, to carry out attacks.” Sharing the footage on social media, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy described the actions of Hamas as “sick”, writing: “They fired at our troops and then retreated back into the hospital.

13 Nov 2023 14.46 CET The EU’s humanitarian aid chief called on Monday for “meaningful” pauses in the fighting in Gaza and urgent deliveries of fuel to keep hospitals working in the territory. “It is urgent to define and respect humanitarian pauses,” Janez Lenarčič, European commissioner for crisis management, told a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Brussels. “Fuel needs to get in. As you could see, more than half of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip stopped working, primarily because of lack of fuel, and fuel is desperately needed.” The EU’s 27 countries issued a statement Sunday saying hospitals “must be protected” and condemning Hamas for using the medical facilities and civilians as “human shields”. The bloc demanded “immediate humanitarian pauses” to allow desperately needed aid into the besieged territory. “These pauses have to be meaningful,” AFP reports Lenarčič said. “First of all, they have to be announced well in advance of the implementation so organisations can prepare to exploit them. Second, they have to be clearly defined time-wise.” Share Updated at 15.04 CET

13 Nov 2023 14.26 CET The UN Palestinian refugee agency’s fuel depot in Gaza has run dry and within a few days UNRWA will no longer be able to resupply hospitals, remove sewage and provide drinking water, its chief said on Monday. The agency chief, commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini, told donors on Monday that it had been slowly emptying a fuel depot on the Israeli border containing strategic reserves. A request to the Israeli military to replenish it had gone unanswered, he said. “That reservoir is now empty,” Reuters reports Lazzarini said. “If we project out a couple of days, by 14 November this will severely impact ambulances and major hospital operations. Some of them have a bit of solar, but it is marginal” he said. UNRWA says it is sheltering nearly 800,000 people, or about half of the total number of Palestinians who have fled their homes since the Israeli military campaign began on 7 October. UNRWA’s fuel is also used to remove hundreds of tonnes of solid waste from increasingly overcrowded camps in southern Gaza, and Lazzarini said these services would soon halt. Without fuel, desalination plants used to provide drinking water to support at least 290,000 people will also stop on 15 November, he added. “So the situation is very dire now and it’s about to get much worse,” Lazzarini told donors.

13 Nov 2023 14.06 CET Summary of the day so far It has just gone 3pm in Gaza City and in Tel Aviv. Here are the latest headlines from the Israel-Hamas war: Israeli forces have reached the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital as hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remained trapped inside. Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but health officials said the remaining patients were dying as a result of energy shortages amid intense fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants. At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died over the past three days, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said.

There are between 600 and 650 inpatients at Shifa, as well as 200 to 500 health workers, and about 1,500 displaced people sheltering there, according to information shared with the World Health Organization. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have repeatedly said that Hamas operates from bunkers underneath Shifa. This has been denied by Hamas and hospital staff.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that an attempt to reach al-Quds hospital from Khan Younis in order to evacuate patients ha d been abandoned because of continuing shelling and shooting . A convey accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross was forced to return as a result of the dangerous conditions.

The IDF issued an update on its military operation in Gaza, saying its forces ha d conducted 4,300 strikes to date. It claims to have struck “approximately 300 tunnel shafts” and “approximately 3,000 terrorist infrastructure sites”. Israel’s campaign was launched on 7 October after the Hamas massacre inside Israel in which 1,200 Israelis were killed. The Hamas-led health ministry in Gaza has said that Israel’s military action in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, including more than 4,000 children. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures.

The UN’s refugee mission in Palestine has reported that one of its buildings in Rafah has been struck by Israel’s navy. Rafah is in the south of the Gaza Strip, within the area that Israel has insisted that Palestinians move to. In a statement, UNRWA said there had been no casualties. It added that UN buildings and facilities in Gaza were hosting nearly 780,000 displaced people and said “they should be protected at all times”.

Haaretz reports that an Israeli civilian hit by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon in northern Israel on Sunday has died of their wounds. Israel’s military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said fire was again being exchanged Monday between Israel and forces in Lebanon . On Sunday, 18 Israelis were injured after the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia fired anti-tank missiles into Israel.

The US carried out strikes against two Iran-linked sites in Syria on Sunday in response to attacks on American forces, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin , said.

Sweden ’s foreign ministry said it could confirm some that Swedes had left Gaza via the Rafah border crossing into Egypt on Monday, but it was unable to give an exact number.

A vessel from Turkey carrying materials for field hospitals arrived on Monday in Egypt ’s port of El Arish, near the Rafah border crossing. A Turkish health official told AFP that the vessel was carrying “materials, generators, ambulances to establish eight field hospitals”. We will set up these hospitals to the areas shown by the Egyptian authorities,” they said.

Authorities in France on Monday detained eight minors over antisemitic chants on the Paris metro that were filmed and widely shared on social media, prosecutors said.

Police in Brazil on Sunday arrested another man suspected of links to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, bringing the number of detainees suspected of involvement with the group to three.

In the UK, former prime minister David Cameron has unexpectedly been appointed foreign secretary in a reshuffle of Rishi Sunak ’s cabinet. Cameron replaces James Cleverly , who visited Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and southern Israel on 11 October, just days after the Hamas attack. The switch comes after the UK’s home secretary, Suella Braverman , the equivalent of an interior minister, was sacked for her controversial comments critical of London’s police ahead of demonstrations held in the capital at the weekend calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

Lord Walney , the UK government’s adviser on political violence and disruption, has said that he believes the majority of the UK’s Jewish population are “living a life of fear at the moment” and it should be treated as “a national emergency”.

Ireland ’s deputy premier has announced he is to travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories later this week. Micheál Martin , who is also foreign affairs minister, will travel to Egypt too.

The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie visited Israel on Sunday, becoming the first Republican attempting to become the next president of the US to visit the country since the 7 October Hamas attack.

The war was triggered when Hamas launched attacks into Israel last month killing 1,200 civilians and taking 240 captive.
Hamas has publicly stated it wants an “all for all deal” – all Israeli hostages for all Palestinian prisonsers in Israel jails.";"Israel’s military confirmed on Thursday that a truce with Hamas will continue, allowing further hostage and prisoner releases and the possibility of more a durable pause in hostilities.

There were frantic diplomatic efforts through the night to prolong the six-day halt to fighting in Gaza which was set to end at 7am local time (5am GMT) on Thursday. The current extension appears to be only for 24 hours, though this has yet to be explicitly confirmed by all parties.

The Israeli military’s confirmation came just minutes before the ceasefire was due to expire.

Just over an hour later, a statement from the office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu office said the war cabinet had come close to ending the truce after unanimously deciding “that if an acceptable list of further prisoners to be released was not delivered by 07:00 this morning [Thursday], fighting would resume at once”.

“A list of women and children – in accordance with the terms of the outline [of the ceasefire agreement last week]– was delivered to Israel a short time ago; therefore, the pause will continue,” it said.

Hamas, which freed 16 hostages in exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners on Wednesday night, also confirmed that the truce would be extended into a seventh day as did Qatar, which has been acting as a mediator.

Hamas claimed that Israel had refused to receive seven women and children and the bodies of three other hostages in exchange for extending the truce, and the last-minute negotiations underlined the extreme fragility of the current ceasefire agreement, as diplomats rush to find a more durable deal that will prevent a return to war.

Both sides have stressed they have the will and capabilities to continue the conflict, with Hamas’s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades telling its forces to “maintain high combat readiness in the last hours of the truce”.

The Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF) said its chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, had “approved the attack plans for the continuation of the campaign”, showing him inspecting maps with his commanders.

“We know what needs to be done, and are ready for the next step,” Halevi said.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Israel for talks on Wednesday night, amid intense international pressure for both sides to extend the pause to allow more hostage releases and additional aid into devastated Gaza.

Conditions in the territory remain “catastrophic”, according to the World Food Programme, and the population faces a “high risk of famine”.

The directors of the CIA and the Mossad, William Burns and David Barnea, spent a second day in Doha in talks with the Qatari government aimed at stretching the truce further. The director of Egypt’s General Intelligence Directorate, Abbas Kamel, was also reported to be taking part in the discussions.

On Wednesday night, before the extension was announced, Israeli military radio said 10 Israelis and four Thais had been handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza. The group included dual citizens with US, German and German nationality, Qatar said. The IDF said two hostages with Russian citizenship had crossed into Egypt.

Thirty Palestinian prisoners were later freed by Israel, including Ahed Tamimi, a well-known 22-year-old activist and writer who was sentenced to eight months in prison for slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier in 2017.

Israeli troops arrested Tamimi on November 6 at her West Bank home, saying a post on her Instagram account was an “incitement to terrorism”. Her mother said the post was fake.

As soon as she got off the Red Cross bus, Tamimi was surrounded by a crowd of supporters and family members. “I am always strong,” Tamimi told one well-wisher before being driven away by relatives toward her home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh.

The two Russian-Israeli hostages released by Hamas were named as were Yelena Trupanob, 50, and her mother, Irena Tati, a doctor aged 73. Hamas said they had been released outside the framework of the Hamas-Israeli hostage deal, as a “tribute” to Vladimir Putin. The other 10 Israeli hostages comprised five women and five children.

Joe Biden said the released hostages included an Israeli-American woman, Liat Beinin, 49, and said he had spoken to her mother and father.

“They’re very appreciative and things are moving well,” he told reporters before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington. “She’ll soon be home with her three children,” he said.

Hamas informed Israeli authorities that three of the hostages had been killed earlier in Israeli bombing of Gaza, naming them as Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two sons: four-year-old Ariel and Kfir, a 10-month-old baby. The IDF said it was investigating the claim about the Bibas family and accused Hamas of behaving in a “cruel and inhuman manner”. There was no independent verification of the claim and previous similar claims have proved unfounded.

The war was triggered when Hamas launched attacks into Israel last month killing 1,200 civilians and taking 240 captive. Israel responded with a military offensive which has killed around 15,000 in Gaza, around 40 percent children, according to Hamas-run local authorities’ figures.

Israel said on Wednesday that about 160 hostages were still held in Gaza. Of those, 126 are men and 35 are women. Four are under the age of 18, and 10 over the age of 75.

Keeping the truce going depends on tougher negotiations over the release of the men Israel says are held captive, including several dozen soldiers.

For the release of Israeli men – and especially soldiers – Hamas is expected to demand freedom for significant numbers of Palestinian men in Israeli jails, including some prominent detainees, a price that Israel may be unwilling to pay without further rounds of fighting which Israeli officials believe may force Hamas into concessions.

An Israeli official involved in hostage negotiations said talks on a further extension for the release of civilian males and soldiers were still preliminary, and that a deal would not be considered until all the women and children were out. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations were ongoing.

Hamas has publicly stated it wants an “all for all deal” – all Israeli hostages for all Palestinian prisonsers in Israel jails.

Netanyahu made clear he had no intention of considering a more lasting ceasefire. “After this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted, will Israel return to fighting? So my answer is an unequivocal yes,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday. “There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end.”"

But when allies such as Australia urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, it is critical that Israel listens because it “faces grave risk if conflict spreads”.
“It is not possible to assure the interests of Israelis without also assuring the same for Palestinians’” she writes.
“Israel has a right to defend itself, but how it defends itself matters as well.";"Australian foreign minister Penny Wong has called for a renewed international effort to find a two-state solution to end the cycle of violence in the Middle East, arguing that Israel can only find peace and security if it can do the same for Palestinians.

Writing for Guardian Australia, Wong outlines the Albanese government’s position in the strongest terms yet, saying that the “status quo is failing everyone” and that the only alternative is to find a “durable peace” through a political process.

While condemning “unequivocally” the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October and affirming Australia’s support for Israel’s right to defend itself, she adds that the way in which Israel does so matters.

“As Australians who treasure our peaceful community and aspire to ever greater unity as a nation, we mourn every innocent life which has been lost in this conflict,” Wong writes.

“In Israel’s response to those attacks, thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including more than 3,500 children, as reported by Unicef. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens by the day.”

Israel must “exercise restraint and protect civilian lives”, she says, as it continues its military action to defeat a “craven terrorist group that has burrowed itself in civilian infrastructure”, and which she says is using civilians as a shield.

But when allies such as Australia urge Israel to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, it is critical that Israel listens because it “faces grave risk if conflict spreads”. She warns that the “international community will not accept ongoing civilian deaths”.

“It is not possible to assure the interests of Israelis without also assuring the same for Palestinians’” she writes.

“A durable peace calls for people to see each other’s humanity. It requires all sides to respect the right of others to exist.

“It will require the dismantling of Hamas – which doesn’t represent the Palestinian people – and a reformed, legitimate Palestinian Authority that disavows violence.”

In an expansion of the government’s thinking beyond resolving borders, she says that a political solution would require “serious international investment in the Palestinian economy”, so that Palestinians could build their own future.

And her tough language also extends to a call for Israeli settlement of occupied Palestinian territories to end, arguing that “even the divided UN security council agreed is a ‘flagrant violation’ of international law and a ‘major obstacle’ to peace. Settler violence against Palestinians must cease and perpetrators held to account”.

The only alternative to the violence is a political solution and there is growing demand around the world for a new diplomatic effort to that end, she says.

“Ultimately, a just and enduring peace requires a two-state solution. An Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state. Israelis and Palestinians living securely and prosperously within internationally recognised borders.”

Wong has consistently called for restraint when it comes to protection of civilian life, modest statements that have still come under partisan attack from the Coalition opposition.

Pressure has been mounting within Labor to do more to call out Israel’s reprisals, with two senior frontbench ministers labelling them collective punishment.

But in a critical UN vote Australia abstained from a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza, arguing it was “incomplete” because it did not mention Hamas as the perpetrator of the 7 October attack.

The government’s leader of the house, Tony Burke, has said people have a right to grieve what they saw happening to Palestinians because “we can’t say we only grieve for certain people who are slaughtered”.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, spoke to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Wednesday.

Asked on Thursday about calls for a ceasefire, Albanese told a conference in Melbourne that “we said a week ago there was a need for a pause for humanitarian concerns – and that remains our position”.

“On the 7th of October people witnessed a terrorist act that shocked the world,” Albanese told The Australian’s Economic and Social Outlook conference.

“Israel has a right to defend itself, but how it defends itself matters as well.

“It must comply with international law, including … the rules of war.

“And is obligated to do all that it can to ensure that innocent civilians are not paying the price for Hamas’ atrocities.”

Albanese said Hamas’ actions had resulted in “devastating loss of life of Israelis”, and called for Israeli hostages to be released unconditionally.

“We’ve also seen an enormous loss of Palestinian life and my view is that every life matters, every innocent life matters whether it is Israeli or Palestinian.”

Albanese said the images from the Jabalia refugee camp were an “enormous concern”, and Israel needed to recognise that the consequences of war expanding would be “dire” for its security."

11 Nov 2023 09.28 CET 'We are minutes away from imminent death,' warns al-Shifa hospital director The al-Shifa hospital director, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, has warned “we are minutes away from imminent death” with patients dying “by the minute”. Speaking from inside the besieged facility in Gaza City to Al Jazeera, he said: All I can say is that we’ve started to lose lives. Patients are dying by the minute, victims and wounded are also dying – even babies in the incubators. We lost a baby in the incubator, we also lost a young man in the intensive care unit. The hospital compound is cordoned off and the buildings of the hospital are targeted. Any moving person within the compound is targeted. The Israeli occupation forces are outside, preventing any person to move… We are totally cut off from the whole world, we are minutes away from imminent death. He added that the hospital has been left without power, internet and water and medical supplies. His comments were translated by Al Jazeera. Strikes have reportedly been increasing near al-Shifa hospital, where it is said more than 50,000 people may have taken shelter. Share Updated at 09.58 CET

11 Nov 2023 09.05 CET Disinformation has flourished across a range of online platforms in the month since Hamas launched its bloody attack on Israel, fuelled by weak content regulation on X, formerly Twitter, and Telegram and at times propelled by state actors. Widely shared faked news and false claims include efforts to downplay the horror of Hamas’s cross-border attack on 7 October through to distasteful allegations that Palestinians, already under heavy bombardment, are faking scenes of violence. Jackson Hinkle, 22, an American far-right social media influencer with 2 million followers on X, formerly Twitter, who has styled himself as a “Maga communist”, claimed, without evidence, at the end of October that Hamas fighters shot fewer than 100 people, mostly armed settlers. The death toll is estimated at more than 1,200 people, and they were killed inside Israel’s borders so could not have been settlers. But this was only one of Hinkle’s untruths: in the same 28 October posting he said that half of the Israelis killed during the Hamas assault were soldiers, many of whom died “during tank shelling”.

11 Nov 2023 08.49 CET Dar al-Shifa hospital, whose name translates as “house of healing”, has long been seen as a vital place of shelter during Israeli attacks. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have fled the bombing for what they hoped was protection in the grounds of the largest hospital in the territory. Now, as Israeli troops surround Gaza City and draw closer to the hospital, the increasing strikes nearby and on parts of the hospital grounds have fuelled fears that the facility and the thousands of civilians sheltering outside will struggle to survive the worst sequence of attacks the city has endured to date.

Our staff at the hospital have reported a catastrophic situation inside just few hours ago,” the aid agency posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. A surgeon is quoted as saying: There is a patient who needs surgery. There is a patient who’s already asleep in our department. We cannot evacuate ourselves and [leave] these people inside. As a doctor. I swear to help the people who need help. Doctors Without Borders said it was currently unable to contact any of its staff in the hospital.

11 Nov 2023 08.19 CET Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Saturday is the first by an Iranian head of state since Tehran and Riyadh ended years of hostility under a China-brokered deal in March. “Gaza is not an arena for words. It should be for action,” Raisi said at Tehran airport before departing for the summit of Arab and Islamic nations in the Saudi capital, as we posted a short while ago. Raisi added: Today, the unity of the Islamic countries is very important. Reuters also reported that Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who is accompanying Raisi, was quoted by the Padolat government website as saying: The summit will send a strong message to warmongers in the region and result in the cessation of war crimes in Palestine. Raisi said in televised comments at Tehran airport: America says it doesn’t want an expansion of the war and has sent messages to Iran and several countries [to this effect]. But these statements are not consistent with America’s actions. The war machine in Gaza is in the hands of America, which is preventing a ceasefire in Gaza and expanding the war.

The Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation were originally meant to meet separately but the Saudi foreign ministry announced early on Saturday that the blocs’ summits would be combined. The move underscores the importance of reaching “a unified collective position that expresses the common Arab and Islamic will regarding the dangerous and unprecedented developments witnessed in Gaza and the Palestinian territories”, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

Telegraph readers' own experiences have shaped their views on the Middle East crisis and they have taken a toll on personal relationships
On October 7, Hamas’s attacks on Israel killed over 1,400 people and took several hundred more hostage. Since then, a full-blown war has impacted the region, with thousands of casualties on both sides. 
In the aftermath of the initial attack, reader Florence Richardson, 27, from Bristol, was horrified. “I know a couple of friends who have family members who lived in Israel so they were quite worried,” she says. “I voiced support for them early on.”
Her personal relationships have an effect on which side she sees eye-to-eye with. “I can’t say I know someone who is based in Gaza… I guess it’s a bit more personal to me.”
Florence, like many others, finds herself at the centre of a storm with friends leaning in different ideological directions.
“I do strongly condemn Hamas… but I can’t say I fully endorse the Israeli government either. They’re not the most ethical with their approach,” she explained.
She underscores the difficulty in engaging in critical discussions, stating that “a lot of these people don’t have personal connections with Gaza or Israel”, further complicating the conversations. 
“If you talk to these people with these kinds of specific views, they’re not the sort of people that are open to a critical discussion or looking at different sides or viewpoints.
“Once some of my more progressive friends started sharing stuff online, my Jewish friends went silent. I feel bad for them and I’m in a position where I’m not sure what I can do or say.”
Ultimately, Florence fears losing friends over the war. “I believe if I were to open up a conversation with my pro-Palestine friends I would be met with pushback and a difficult strained tense conversation with those people.”

Reader Charlie Collins, a 72-year-old resident of West County in Exeter, presents a contrasting perspective. He staunchly proclaims: “I’m in no way anti-Jewish, but I’m certainly anti-Zionist.” 
His personal experiences have shaped his perspective. As a child, Charlie spent time in South Africa and said: “I became very anti-racist from what I saw there. Seeing different doors for black and white people. I saw police beating up black people.”
“[Israel] is a colonial apartheid regime and the Palestinians do not have equal rights.”
“The Israelis of all people should know that herding an ethnic group behind a fence, enclosing them, starving them, and then systematically killing them is an amoral thing to do and has no excuse whatsoever.”
Charlie has spent his life working as a doctor in globally underserved areas such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Fiji. His daughter followed the same path and used to work in Gaza.
“I know from secondhand personal experience – my daughter having been there – how subjugated people are there,” Charlie explained. “She has got friends there running for their lives and others scared.”
His family share his viewpoint but his friends are more varied in belief. “There are others who don’t know the background,” he said. “[The attack] did not come in a vacuum…there are reasons that lie behind it.”
One in 10 have broken a friendship
In an exclusive survey by OnePoll, half of the respondents believed that in the Israel-Hamas war, neither side is wholly right and that there is a need for a negotiated peace. Due to this lack of consensus, one in 10 have broken a friendship through discussing sensitive politics. 
Florence elaborates: “With my generation, there’s more of a culture of if you differ in political views in any way, it’s more justifiable to cut off that friendship. It’s why I’m always nervous to start political discussions with my friends on certain subjects.” 
Tina Wilson, a relationship expert and founder of the Wingman app, notes: “Since Brexit, political polarisation has been straining many friendships that didn’t exist before. This latest war has caused total division in relationships in both business and personal lives, for both political and religious beliefs.”
While Tina thinks diverse perspectives and friendships do enhance personal growth, she adds: “In such extreme instances, it might become essential to distance yourself from friends who consistently advocate for detrimental or incompatible ideologies to your own.”
Ultimately, Florence is able to see the other side. “I do have empathy for people on the other side and people who are equally concerned about those suffering in Gaza and the loss of life there.”
Mick concludes: “One is biased by experiences you have.”"

The only workable outcome is a two-state solution. Anyone not pushing towards that goal has no intention of making peace at all
An important milestone in the Israel-Hamas war was reached last week, with both parties agreeing to a hostage-for-prisoner swap and a humanitarian pause in fighting. 
This may be a glimmer of hope in the physical warfare of the Middle East but there has been no such let up on the post-truth Western front, where hyperbole and lies are sowing the seeds of hatred at the expense of peace. 
This is because what the Free Palestine movement really wants is not for Israel to cease its military action but to cease to exist at all. 
Let us not forget that pro-Palestine celebrations erupted around the world on October 7 before Israel had responded forcefully to Hamas’ grotesque attacks. Let us not ignore that they marched again this weekend under the guise of demanding an Israeli ceasefire, even though there already is one. 
The joy and peacefulness of Sunday’s 100,000-strong march against anti-Semitism compared to the violence and hostility of the Free Palestine protests is further proof that the latter are not pro-anything as much as they are anti-Israel. 
The widespread, blind hatred of Israel is so severe that some Palestine supporters cannot muster up an ounce of sympathy for kidnapped Israeli children, ripping down posters of hostages. Feminists cannot bring themselves to denounce Hamas’ mass rape of women, with UN Women taking seven weeks to publish an Instagram post condemning Hamas’ barbarity – and then deleting it within moments, replaced with a toned down version calling for an investigation into “reports of gender-based violence”. Palestinian-American model Gigi Hadid recently posted a photo on social media falsely portraying Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Manasra as a “child prisoner of war” to her 79 million followers – five times the number of Jews in the world. Amnesty International, in a social media post about the hostages, only mentioned two from Thailand. 
The truth is, there is plenty to criticise Israel for – and many Jews and Israelis do. Its expansion of settlements and treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, for one. Israelis were protesting against Benjamin Netanyahu this very weekend, as they were all year before October 7 had the unintended effect of uniting a factious country. 
It is the leap from “Israel must change” to “Israel must die” that reveals the toxicity at the heart of the Free Palestine movement. As a non-Jewish friend said to me this week: “When I criticise Indian policy in Kashmir, no one seriously thinks that India shouldn’t exist or should be destroyed.”
Criticising Israeli policies and politicians is not antisemitic. Denying Jewish indigeneity to the land and considering the entire country an occupation is. 
Lamenting that too many people have been killed in Gaza is not antisemitic. Falsely accusing Israel of committing “genocide” when Hamas has explicitly said it will not stop until Israel is annihilated is. 
Refuting hard evidence – such as the record of brutalities on October 7 or the existence of Hamas tunnels under hospitals – in favour of nonsensical conspiracy theories is antisemitic. Singling out the world’s only Jewish state as a bad actor and turning a blind eye to true horrors happening elsewhere is antisemitic. Seeing Israel as pure evil while describing the grotesque crimes of its terrorist enemy as “justified resistance” is not only antisemitic but perverse.
Taking these extreme positions does nothing but fan the flames of hate and obscure any chance of either side achieving a positive outcome. Until this vitriol subsides, there will be no progress towards peace. Those determined to see the issue in only black and white ignore the vast grey area where valid criticism and reasonable debate could force change on both sides. 
The blinkered Free Palestine movement must ask itself honestly: what is the actual goal here? They chant “from the river to the sea” and brazenly call for intifada – the word used for the years of Palestinian suicide bombs at Israeli bus stops and cafes – but what would these look like in reality? 
Assuming they do not actually intend to massacre Jews, do they expect seven million Israeli Jews to up sticks and leave? Where does it expect them to go? The majority of Israeli Jews are either from this very strip of land or from other Middle Eastern and North African countries that have killed or expelled their entire Jewish populations in the last century and would not welcome them back now. 
Do they expect two million Arab Israelis used to living with equal rights in a modern democracy and thriving economy to accept autocratic, tyrannical leaders who subjugate women and quash freedom of expression? Do they expect 800,000 or so LGBT people to happily give up their rights? 
A better use of Free Palestine’s time would be to help build a future nation, not try to tear one down. 
It is true that in 1948, around 700,000 Palestinians lost their homes. 
It is also true that, from 1948 onwards, 900,000 Jews were forced to flee their homes in Arab countries. This came just a few years after millions of Jews were killed or displaced in eastern Europe. My maternal grandparents, for example, moved to Middlesbrough from Leipzig and to Buenos Aires from Vienna in the late 1930s; my paternal ancestors had fled Russia a generation earlier, settling in London’s East End and Edinburgh. There’s barely a Jew in the world who doesn’t have a story like this in their recent history. Yet we do not consider ourselves refugees. We do not hold the current inhabitants of those countries responsible or call for their destruction.
Palestinians, on the other hand, have been trapped in refugee status for 75 years. They are the only people with a United Nations agency dedicated solely to their refugeehood (UNRWA); all other refugees in the world fall under another body, UNHCR. UNRWA, which is the UN’s largest agency, does not share UNHCR’s mission to repatriate or resettle people so they are no longer refugees. Instead it has redefined the status of refugee, applicable only to Palestinians, so that their descendants for unlimited generations – including adopted children – can also register as refugees. That is why 700,000 Palestinians were displaced in 1948 but there are six million Palestinian refugees today. 
The Israeli writer Yuval Noah Harari said the curse of history is that people try to save the past instead of saving the future. 
Palestinians yearning for pre-1948 life is neither realistic nor particularly ambitious, given the land actually was governed then by white colonialists. There was never a sovereign state of Palestine before 1948, but there can be one today. For this to happen, supporters of both sides must bury their venomous hatred, eschew extremist positions and accept the legitimate existence of their neighbour. 
A free Palestine predicated on the destruction of Israel is an empty dream. The only workable outcome is a two-state solution where Palestine has sovereignty and Israel has security. Anyone not working towards that goal has no intention of making peace at all."

Anonymous letter sent to media rival says corporation is guilty of ‘double standards’
The BBC has been accused by its own journalists of favouritism towards Israel and a failure to “humanise Palestinian victims” in the ongoing conflict.
In a 2,300-word letter that eight of the corporation’s UK-based journalists penned to Al Jazeera, they accused their employer of failing to “accurately” cover the Israel-Hamas conflict since the war began.
The journalists, who asked Al Jazeera to not to share their identities for fear of reprisal, wrote that “humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking” and accused the BBC of being guilty of a “double standard in how civilians are seen”.
Since the proscribed terror group Hamas invaded Israel last month, the corporation has been under fire with claims of bias and controversy.
The latest has seen outcry from their own headquarters in the UK, with the journalists writing: “The BBC has failed to accurately tell this story – through omission and lack of critical engagement with Israel’s claims – and it has therefore failed to help the public engage with and understand the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza.”
The letter continues: “Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since Oct 7. When will the number be high enough for our editorial stance to change?”
The group told Al Jazeera they do not plan to send their letter to the broadcaster’s executives, reportedly because they believe that it will not lead to any meaningful discussions.
A BBC spokesman insisted that the corporation’s coverage “has made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Gaza and Israel”.
It comes after the broadcaster stopped describing Hamas as “militants” by default at the end of last month, after complaints by Jewish leaders about its refusal to refer to Hamas killers as “terrorists”.
Meanwhile, Danny Cohen, the director of BBC Television, told The Telegraph last week that Britain’s Jewish people are “being harmed through its unbalanced reporting” as he accused a BBC journalist of pro-Palestine bias on her social media feed.
However, the letter from a small group of the corporation’s employees insisted that there is an unequal level of empathy shown to Israeli and Palestinian victims in regards to the death toll in Gaza from Israeli military bombardment, which is attempting to eliminate Hamas.
The journalists said terms like “massacre” and “atrocity” are reserved “only for Hamas, framing the group as the only instigator and perpetrator of violence in the region. This is inaccurate but aligns with the BBC’s overall coverage”.
They added that Hamas’s attack on Oct 7, “while appalling and devastating… does not justify the indiscriminate killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the BBC cannot be seen to support – or fail to interrogate – the logic that it does.
“We are asking the BBC to better reflect and defer to the evidence-based findings of official and unbiased humanitarian organisations.”
The anonymous reporters claimed that the broadcaster’s portrayal of Israel suffering was more thorough, for example, telling audiences the names of victims, covering funerals and interviewing families.
Meanwhile, they said, “in comparison humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking”.
Not consistent 
The journalists acknowledged “some strong isolated examples”, but said sensitively told stories about Palestinians were not “consistent”, particularly at the onset of the war.
The letter also reveals that the BBC has organised “trauma support and listening sessions” for staff who are affected by the conflict.
The BBC spokesman said: “The BBC is one of the only news organisations to have journalists inside Gaza, and our journalists have been able to provide on the ground reporting, first-hand testimony and analysis on what is happening on the ground.
“This has included many stories of Palestinian victims and first-hand testimony from civilians, doctors and aid-workers in Gaza, as well as a Panorama documentary, featuring human stories from both sides.
“BBC News has also examined the history and complexities of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and continues to provide historical context and explainers throughout our coverage online, on our dedicated podcast -The Conflict – and on our radio and TV news programmes.
“When interviewing either the Israeli government, Hamas, Palestinian representatives, or other leaders, we are robust, challenging and aim to hold power to account.”
The corporation pointed to a comprehensive list of examples of BBC coverage on the war, which included dozens of human stories of Palestinian suffering."

Danny Cohen, the director from 2013 to 2015, says Britain's Jewish population 'harmed' by the broadcaster's 'unbalanced reporting'
The BBC’s former head of television has called for an independent review into the corporation’s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, as he accused a diplomatic correspondent of showing pro-Palestine bias.
Danny Cohen, the director of BBC Television from 2013 to 2015, said Britain’s Jewish people are “being harmed through its unbalanced reporting” since the war began.
He said: “The time has now come for a long-overdue independent inquiry into the corporation’s editorial and management failures in its reporting of Israel.”
In one example, he pointed out how Caroline Hawley, the BBC’s diplomatic correspondent, has written numerous posts on X, formerly Twitter, expressing concern for the “shocking” and “terrifying” situation in Gaza, sharing calls for a ceasefire and providing multiple updates on the number of deaths there.
But The Telegraph found that just nine per cent – or 18 – of her 195 tweets and retweets since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7 have mentioned Israeli deaths, casualties and hostages, including case studies of families captured.
Since the proscribed terror group Hamas invaded Israel last month, Ms Hawley has frequently updated her 8,600 followers on the death toll in Gaza from Israeli military bombardment, which is attempting to eliminate Hamas.

Only last week, she wrote: “New life amid all the death and destruction – with more than 4,000 children killed, 100 UNRWA staff dead and 200 medics no longer able to help heal patients.”
That followed multiple other tweets commenting on how “the number of civilians killed in Gaza grows and grows” and sharing updates from the United Nations, other UN agencies, charities, NGOs and activists on Gaza death tolls and their various calls for a humanitarian ceasefire.
Earlier this month, Ms Hawley tweeted: “What shocks me in this small glimpse of the terror civilians are enduring in Gaza is how calm people appear. I guess there’s little choice.”
While she has reported on Israeli hostages and music festival victims on-air, on X she criticised the “shocking level of destruction in the Jabaliya refugee camp” following Israeli bombing without mentioning the Israeli Defence Force’s justification that it was a stronghold for Hamas terrorists.
BBC faces ‘urgent’ questions
Mr Cohen, who is also the former BBC One controller, said her “biased, unbalanced” social media feed “reads like a series of press releases from Hamas central command”, as he demanded an inquiry into the corporation’s wider coverage following a series of rows.
He told The Telegraph: “Day after day Hawley reposts messages and photographs from Gaza without context or any apparent attempt at basic journalistic verification. There is barely a mention of the October 7 massacres or the ongoing plight of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
“So why has Hawley been allowed to continue to report in such a biased, unbalanced way? Is the BBC ok with her reporting or unable to control it? This is a question it must urgently answer.”
He claimed “the BBC’s credibility with the Jewish community is reaching a point of no return”, adding: “With these incidents piling up on a daily basis there is only one conclusion to draw. Either the BBC’s senior management is complicit in these egregious examples of bias, these regular breaches of its guidelines, or it lacks the ability to control the output of its own organisation.”
Investigation launched into BBC staff’s social media activity
The row comes after Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, threatened to cut off access to the BBC last month over its “atrocious” refusal to describe Hamas as terrorists.
The BBC also apologised on air last week after a newsreader twice mistakenly claimed that Israeli forces were “targeting medical staff and Arab speakers” at Gaza’s largest hospital.
And the corporation launched an “urgent” investigation after social media activity by several of its journalists in the BBC News Arabic bureau appeared to celebrate and justify the Hamas attack.
A BBC spokesman said: “We take complaints about social media use very seriously, especially on such a sensitive and contested subject, and investigate accordingly. Impartiality is crucial for BBC news staff, and our guidelines require them to reflect a wide range of opinion in their social media. We will continue to remind all our journalists of their responsibilities.”
‘A new inquiry is essential’
On Sunday night, Michael Ellis, the former attorney general for England and Wales, backed Mr Cohen’s call for an independent inquiry of the BBC’s coverage.
The senior Conservative MP told The Telegraph: “The BBC are still concealing the contents of a report conducted nearly 20 years ago that was commissioned because of allegations then of BBC bias against Israel in their reporting on the Middle East.
“Licence-payers money was spent compiling the report and then more licence-payers money was spent fighting through the courts to conceal it from the licence-payers.
“As the BBC still refuse to release it, now there is no alternative but to commission another report - this time independent of the BBC. 
“It is crucial people around the world can have confidence that the BBC is reporting fairly and accurately and it is quite clear that there is very real concern that their reporting of Israel now does not come close to commanding the confidence of viewers at home or abroad. A new inquiry is essential.”"

You must be joking
A group of its own reporters claim that BBC coverage has been unfavourable to Palestinians. Are they serious?
The BBC has been accused of bias in its coverage of Gaza. Nothing unusual there, you might think. But wait. There’s a twist.
This time, it’s been accused of bias towards Israel.
The accusation comes from none other than a group of the BBC’s own reporters. Eight of them, all unnamed, have sent a letter to the Qatari news organisation Al Jazeera, alleging that, on the BBC, “humanising coverage of Palestinian civilians has been lacking”, and that “the positions taken by governments in the UK and US have undue influence on coverage”.
The letter is no doubt heartfelt. I wonder, though, if there are one or two tiny things its writers have overlooked.
Perhaps, for example, they’ve forgotten about the BBC’s refusal to refer to Hamas as terrorists – even though, in Britain, that’s how Hamas is officially classified. They may also have forgotten about the time one of the BBC’s news anchors misreported a story from Reuters to suggest that Israel was “targeting” medical staff. And the time one of its correspondents said it was “hard to see” how anyone but the Israelis could have caused an explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital. (UK intelligence sources believe that it was actually caused by a wayward Palestinian rocket.)
Only the other day, the BBC’s best-paid presenter, Gary Lineker, urged his 8.9million followers on Twitter/X to watch a video in which an academic accuses Israel of committing “textbook genocide”. So, if the BBC does indeed favour Israel, this bias does not appear to be shared by all its top staff.
In my view, though, the most memorable moment of the BBC’s coverage came when Jeremy Bowen, its International Editor, was discussing the stash of assault rifles that had been discovered inside Gaza’s Shifa Hospital. Apparently, the stash did not necessarily prove Israel had been right to say Hamas uses hospitals as military bases. According to Mr Bowen, it was “not inconceivable” that the weapons instead belonged to “the security department of the hospital”.
Well, of course. Every hospital in the world equips its staff with Kalashnikovs. That’s how the NHS plans to get its waiting lists down.  
Are Remainers really brainier?
A new study purports to show that people who voted Remain in 2016 are more intelligent than people who voted Leave. To say the least, this is a provocative claim. But it also strikes me as somewhat unlikely.
After all, if Remainers are so dazzlingly ingenious, how come they didn’t win?
With such an immense advantage over their opponents, the referendum campaign should have been a doddle. Thanks to their vastly superior brainpower, they should effortlessly have outwitted Dominic Cummings and his band of fellow simpletons. Mysteriously, however, they didn’t.
Mind you, the study doesn’t say that every Remainer is more intelligent than every Leaver. It just says that Remainers are more intelligent overall. So I suppose it’s possible that the staff of the Remain campaign were drawn exclusively from the small minority of stupid Remainers, while all the millions of intelligent Remainers were otherwise occupied with their careers as brain surgeons, rocket scientists, Nobel Prize-winning poets, Match of the Day presenters, etc.
But if so, why didn’t the intelligent Remainers notice that the stupid Remainers were running such a disastrously incompetent campaign, and order them to change tack? Were the intelligent Remainers all too busy curing cancer, translating Finnegans Wake into Old Norse and reciting Pi to eight million decimal places?
The other possibility, of course, is that Remain campaigners were simply too clever for their own good. Their genius lulled them into a false sense of security. As a result, they got lazy, and lost. Just like the hare who stopped for a nap during his race with the tortoise.
Then again, the moral of that fable is not merely that the hare is complacent. It’s that he’s an idiot.
Mrs Hunt’s unhappy birthday
I wouldn’t want to be in Jeremy Hunt’s shoes. But not because he’s finding it so hard to get the economy going. It’s because this week, he forgot to buy his wife a birthday present.
“I didn’t even get her a card,” the Chancellor confessed, during an interview on LBC radio. “I feel incredibly guilty.”
This isn’t the first time poor Lucia has been let down by her husband’s faulty memory. Remarkably, he once managed to forget what nationality she is. During a trip to Beijing as Foreign Secretary, he told local dignitaries that his wife was Japanese. She’s Chinese.
How on earth any man could contrive to get his wife’s nationality wrong, I’ve no idea. Whatever faults I may have as a husband, at least I’ve never said, “Please, let me introduce my wife. She’s from Kuala Lumpur. Sorry, no – I mean Kent.”
Still, God bless Lucia. She’s clearly a very kind and forgiving woman. Let’s just hope she and her husband are never invited to appear on Mr and Mrs – the TV game show in which couples are tested on how much they know about each other.
“Jeremy, here’s your first question. What is your wife’s name?”
“Ooh, that’s a tricky one. Hang on, wait a minute, I’m sure I know this. It’s on the tip of my tongue. Er... Lizzie? Linda? Morag? Myfanwy? Saoirse? Svetlana? Parvati? Yetunde?”

The comment appeared to visibly shock presenter Fiona Bruce and immediately prompted outrage on social media
An audience member on BBC Question Time compared Israel’s efforts to defeat Hamas to the Holocaust in an incident that has provoked outrage among British Jews.
During Thursday night’s episode of the panel show, a man in the crowd questioned whether the killing of the terrorist group’s members was “a little bit like the final solution”.
“I’d like to know how many Palestinians need to be killed to justify the number of people being killed in the kibbutz,” he said.
“And the other point I would like to make - there is a constant talk about we are going to clear Hamas out of the country and clear them all together. Isn’t this a little bit like the final solution?”
The comments appeared to visibly shock BBC presenter Fiona Bruce, who replied: “Well, that’s quite a thing to say.”
The moment immediately prompted outrage on social media, with the head of the Holocaust Educational Trust criticising the comments as “ignorant” and “deeply offensive”.
Karen Pollock, the organisation’s chief executive, wrote on Twitter: “Did the audience member @‌bbcquestiontime actually compare efforts to defeat Hamas terrorists to The Final Solution?? I’m in shock.
“I had to rewatch this to be sure I hadn’t misheard. I hadn’t.
“This is an outrageous, ignorant and deeply offensive comment to make.”
The audience member’s question was put to Marie van der Zyl, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, whose response prompted laughter from some of those in the crowd.
She said the situation in the Middle East was “absolutely not” like the final solution, adding: “Hamas are terrorists, Hamas are like Isis, and I’m sure in this country - and Israel is a country the size of Wales - if 1,400 people were brutally murdered and beheaded I’m sure that you would want to know that action was going to be taken.”
Ms van der Zyl said Israel “isn’t at war with the people of Gaza or Palestinians”, but Hamas.
She asserted that Israel was “not an apartheid state”, causing some members of the audience to laugh and shake their heads.
“All of its citizens, whether they’re Arab citizens or Israeli citizens, all have equal rights under Israeli law and if anybody in the Middle East wanted, for example, to be gay that would be the country to be in,” she added. “You might laugh but Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East.”

Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement or Ukraine's war against Russia appear not to care about the Oct 7 massacres
A month ago today, the terrorist group Hamas launched a barbaric attack on the people of Israel. I have learnt an awful lot since that murderous day. I have learnt so much that it has changed the way I see the world and made me wonder whether things will ever be the same again.
I learnt that massacres of Jews for no other reason than they are Jewish can still happen. That pogroms did not end in the 20th century as I had come to believe.
I learnt that Jews could experience a level of barbarism at the hands of their enemies so extreme that it is hard to process. Families burned to death in their houses. Children murdered in front of their parents. Women raped before being killed. Kidnappings. Beheadings. Unspeakable cruelty. I realised that this genocidal barbarism had not ended with the fall of the Nazis in 1945. It could be repeated with a sinister contemporary twist, the kidnappings and butchery streamed live on Facebook for the world to see.
I learnt that the Jewish pledge of ‘‘never again’’ after the Holocaust did not come true. That it could happen again. That it had.
And I learnt that many people just didn’t care. That as it was Jews being massacred it could be overlooked and ignored. That it was somehow different. That silence and apathy could again feed the poison of Jew hatred as it had done in the 1930s.
I watched as just days after the massacres in Israel a group of well-known entertainers calling themselves Artists for Palestine spoke up for the people of Gaza but had no empathy to extend to Jewish people. For some reason they forgot to even mention the murder of 1,400 Jews and the kidnapping of hundreds more. I discovered that the terrorist attacks of Oct 7 were somehow different from the Black Lives Matter movement or the plight of Ukraine and were not worthy of solidarity or remembrance, whether that be in student unions or at Wembley Stadium.
Out on the streets of Britain, I learnt that anti-Semitism is alive and well. I watched as tens of thousands marched in opposition to Israel, a country still burying its dead and searching for its kidnapped children. Masked men called for jihad against Jews. Genocidal chants rung out in central London. I wondered where these people were during recent Middle East conflicts when lives were being lost in the Syrian civil war or the battle to destroy Islamic State. We did not see them on the streets en masse then. Their vitriolic anger seems solely focused on the Jewish State, their protest a statement of anti-Semitism as much as a call to support the innocent in Gaza.

Pro-Palestine march in London: Police make terror arrest at Piccadilly Circus


Talking to friends, I heard racist horror story after racist horror story, right here in Britain. The poster of kidnapped Israeli children defaced with Hitler moustaches. Threats and intimidation on university campuses. The toxic waste of social media overflowing with anti-Semitism. Jewish people in our country taking unprecedented steps to protect their safety and that of their children.
British Jews must carry on
I should also say that amidst this rude awakening there have been sparks of light, reasons for optimism and gratitude. I have seen the UK Government stand up firmly against terrorism and support Israel’s right to self-defence. I have watched President Biden stand by Israel and warn off its enemies. I have been moved to tears by messages from many non-Jewish friends, expressing sympathy, support and solidarity.
Now, the question that really matters is what should I and other Jews do with all we have learnt? What can we take from this rude awakening other than pain, sorrow and grief? Should we be fearful? Should we hide? Should we make plans to travel, just in case? If we did, where would we go?
To these questions I have a very clear answer. What I have learnt in the month since the Hamas attacks has left me very certain of how we must respond.
British Jews must proudly carry on our Jewish life. We must not be intimidated. We should not live in fear. We must stand up to prejudice wherever we see it. We must take the hands of our non-Jewish friends who support us and work with them to ensure that anti-Semitism does not prevail.
The Jewish people have been here before - not once, not twice but countless times.
The Jewish people have been here before and got through it. And we will get through it again."

“Clueless” protesters have invited ridicule of pro-Palestine marches after admitting that they did not know whether Hamas attacked Israel.
Two young activists, who have not been identified, were interviewed about the terrorist assault on Israel on Oct 7 as they joined a demonstration in London last Saturday.
But they appeared to have little knowledge of what exactly they were protesting about, with one admitting they needed to be “more clued up”.
In a clip shared online, an interviewer from the Campaign Against Antisemitism asks the pair: “When Hamas invaded Israel on 7th October, what was your initial reaction to that?”
One replies: “I don’t believe they did, did they? Hamas?”
The other responds nervously: “I think so... honestly I think I need to be a bit more clued up on everything that’s going on, so I feel like I’m not really qualified to answer that too well.”
The first activist then adds: “I mean, I’m not sure if I’ve seen anything that shows that that’s actually happened or factually correct.”
She was holding a placard reading: “Rishi, Keir U must be invertebrates cause ur spineless!!!! Call 4 ceasefire.”
Some 1,400 Israelis were killed and 200 taken hostage when Hamas, a proscribed terror group, stormed the Jewish state and sparked a ground and air mission from Israel to eliminate the militants in Palestine.
It comes as 70,000 activists prepare to march on Armistice Day, the fifth mass pro-Palestine protest in London in as many weeks despite furious opposition from the Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who partly cited The Telegraph’s findings that half of the organisers have links to Hamas.
The clip has gone viral on social media with anti-Semitism campaigners saying it shows “willful idiocy”.
‘Clueless and dangerous’
The Campaign Against Antisemitism told The Telegraph that it “showcases the toxic combination of ignorance and support for terrorism that motivates too many of the protesters on these marches”.
A spokesman added: “These people are clueless and dangerous. Is it any surprise that opinions such as these, accompanied by genocidal chanting, anti-Semitic signage and calls for violence, are terrifying the Jewish community?
“London cannot continue to be a no-go zone for Jewish people week after week.”
A Community Security Trust spokesman said: “These two people are a stunning example of willful idiocy, ripe picking for whatever extremist ideology comes down the track, including anti-Semitism.”
At the London pro-Palestine march last weekend where the video was filmed, a total of 29 people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences, racially motivated crimes and assaulting a police officer. Six people have been charged.
The Metropolitan Police said fireworks were thrown at officers and a pamphlet reported to support Hamas was on sale."

We have reached a pivotal moment in this conflict. The terrorist group is increasingly isolated, its defeat assured
It was not only Israel which was unaware in advance of the atrocious October 7 attack. Iran’s supreme leader has accused Hamas of not giving any prior warning. And Hizbollah fighters were reportedly not even on alert in villages close to the border. “We woke up to a war,” a Hizbollah commander said. There is, as the saying goes, no honour among thieves. 
In what is surely a pivotal moment for this conflict, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has now told Hamas that while Iran would continue to provide political and moral backing, it would not intervene directly. One might argue that Iran has done enough; its financial support for Hamas is said to be worth $100 million a year. And it is certainly the case that Iran has encouraged its complex network of militias and terrorist groups to target Israel. It doesn’t take direct confrontation to inflict unimaginable harm.
But without Iran’s assistance, the destruction of Hamas – which wrought such brutality on the people of Israel – may be assured. 
Did Hamas foresee this response, that there would be limits to the support some partners in the “axis of evil” would provide? Perhaps a more important question is: would it have mattered? These terrorists are fanatical, driven not just by a desire to torpedo normalisation in the region but also the destruction of an independent country.
The military solution, therefore, is for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to neutralise Hamas as quickly as possible. The West can help by channelling humanitarian aid in and evacuating the injured whilst the IDF eliminate the terrorists. There are enough US and UK hospital ships and helicopters just off the Gazan beaches to do this, and now.
Winning the battle to defeat Hamas axiomatically may be the easy part in relative terms.  Winning the peace, creating long term stability in the region, is what must be the focus for politicians and diplomats in Washington, London, Riyadh, Doha and Tehran, and of course Tel Aviv.  
But they will be doing so against a backdrop of Hamas failure. The group has not managed to inflame the Middle East as was their want, with escalation not looking likely at this stage. And while there may be pro-Palestinian marches occurring in the progressive West, the evidence is that the Arab world is turning against Hamas. As Jake Wallis Simons, the editor of The Jewish Chronicle, has suggested: “Anecdotally, it seems that the merciless, drug-fuelled hyper-violence meted out by Hamas savages has provoked queasiness and concern even among natural supporters of the Palestinian cause.”
It is arguably more likely that a solution which includes two states, with security and prosperity for these two countries, will be reached than it was before October 7. Now is the time for determined leadership from the West rather than the unedifying scenes seen at Westminster. Now is the time for David Cameron – and even Tony Blair – to atone for previous blunders in the Middle East. 
If other groups like Isis and Hizbollah realise that Iran will no longer underwrite their terror, where does that leave them? Though the direct conflict between Israel and Hamas could come to a swifter end than many feared, its implications will be vast. "

“We are here from all faiths and none to lean on each other,” Moran told the crowd.";"Layla Moran: ‘We must calm discussions about Israel and Palestine – or Britain may end up in a bad place’
As the first MP of Palestinian heritage, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson says her heritage gives her an ‘extraordinary responsibility’
Where, I ask Layla Moran, were you when you learnt that Hamas terrorists had stormed Israel, murdering more than 1,400 people including babies, children and the elderly.
“I was at a car boot sale near Bicester. We’d planned a nice day out...” She pauses, contemplating the jarring juxtaposition between the horrific and the commonplace. “And I remember hearing about it, and your heart just plummets through your stomach. First of all, just because of the scale of what they had done. How on earth did they get in? How on earth did they take so many hostages? So my first thought was, it must be Iran; they must be behind it.
“And when I visited Israel I had been to kibbutzim that were taken over, and had met people living in them, so your heart immediately turns to them, and, thank God, they are alive, but they have lost friends and family. And then your mind goes to, this is going to be bad. Even then, I appreciated the scale of that – and as we talk it’s getting worse and worse.’  
Moran, who is 41, is the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and International Development, and the first – and still the only – person of Palestinian heritage to be elected as an MP. In 2017 she defeated the sitting Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood by 816 to become MP for Oxford and Abingdon, increasing her majority at the 2019 election to 8,943. 
She describes herself as British Palestinian. Her father is James Moran, who served for many years as a diplomat for the EU; her mother Randa is Palestinian.
When Moran became an MP, she says, her mother cautioned her about putting her Palestinian identity at the forefront of her politics. But in recent weeks, in Parliament, in media interviews and at public events. she has found herself speaking about little else.
“I feel the weight of my heritage on my shoulders at this critical moment,” she says. “That’s an extraordinary responsibility but one that I am very grateful to have.
“So many people right now that are grieving and seeing the suffering – and I don’t think you need to have heritage there to share in that suffering – feel helpless. And I am lucky because I do have a voice, and I feel that responsibility of using that wisely. That’s what underlies every interview I do, every intervention in the house, the ultimate aim is how I can make peace more likely.”
We meet in Moran’s parliamentary office. On the lapel of her tailored jacket she is wearing a poppy made from sequins, given to her by a Sikh constituent at a recent peace vigil in Banbury. Threaded on a slim chain around her neck is a small evil eye. 
“I’m not a superstitious person. But I wear it often, especially when I’m doing my job.” She smiles. “It makes no sense whatsoever, but there you go.”
Her manner is earnest, forthright, determined to put her point across, but at the same time weighing her words carefully, mindful of how much of a minefield, how polarising the subject is, where it seems everybody feels the obligation to…
“Pick a side…?” She interrupts. “Yes, and I totally reject that narrative. It’s incredibly important that in the words all politicians use right now they actively avoid language that does that.
“The fact is, this is not a conflict where there is one clear bad guy, or one clear good guy. And I think most people are on the side of humanity and are beginning to understand that this is not simple, and actually you can be on the side of the Israelis and condemn the terrorists that are Hamas, and the atrocities they committed, and also care deeply for the people who have lost loved ones in Gaza, care for the Palestinian cause and want peace. All of those things can be true at the same time. And you don’t have to pick a side.’
Moran’s family on her mother’s side are Greek Orthodox Christian, residents of Jerusalem going back many generations, who were displaced in 1948 at the time of the creation of the state of Israel. 
“My grandfather tells how when he was five years old they decided to leave. The bombing of the King David hotel was a particular catalyst for that. They lost their house, their belongings, everything. They were refugees.”
They fled to Jericho, sheltering in the monastery at the Mount of Temptation, and then to Jordan, where Moran’s mother attended university, before coming to Britain to study for her masters in landscape design at Wye College in Kent. It was there she met James Moran.
“There’s a lovely story of how Dad spotted her across the cafeteria floor, and that was that.”
The family led a peripatetic life. Following her father’s postings, Moran was educated at private schools in Belgium, Greece, Ethiopia, Jamaica and Jordan and finally Roedean, before going on to study physics at Imperial College, gaining a PGCE at Brunel College and an MA at the Institute of Education, going on to work as a teacher before entering Parliament.
Growing up, her awareness of her Palestinian heritage was largely confined to her mother cooking Palestinian food, “which I loved”, and listening to Palestinian music in the car. “Like all children, we told her to switch it off.
“It wasn’t really at all a political thing. Occasionally, something would happen on the television, and she and my grandparents would break down. From a child’s perspective we didn’t fully understand why, and they sheltered us a bit from it.”
It was in her teenage years, when her father was posted to Jordan, that she first began to ask questions about politics. “Why is this happening? Why can’t I have a Palestinian passport? And then you have the conversation, well there is no recognised state of Palestine, which is part of my identity. Can you imagine someone telling you, there is no Britain? The schism is very deep.”
Her mother had not returned to Jerusalem since the family had fled all those years before, but, along with Moran, visited the city, and crossed into the West Bank under the protection of diplomatic plates from Jordan.
“She remembered what it had been like to go across the crossings, and they took her shoes and threw them into a warehouse. She was just scared of reliving some of those memories.”
It was then that Moran met members of her extended family for the first time – cousins, cousins of cousins. “Arab families are very large… The family I’ve got in Gaza are sheltering in a church. They are down to one meal a day and one shower a week. They literally cannot move. And it’s heartbreaking that they can’t. I wake up every morning afraid that I’m not going to be able to answer the question, how are they, with ‘they’re alive’”. 
The situation is desperate. We are, she says, a long way from a ceasefire. “Most conflicts do end in a ceasefire, but a ceasefire is not the end of the war, or the conflict either.” That, she believes, can only be resolved by a two-state solution.
“Any kind of transition from this point cannot include Hamas. That is clear. Equally, if you want the Arab states to be involved, Netanyahu can’t be included either.
“But Hamas feeds off an idea, and it’s an idea that only exists because we don’t have a Palestinian state. And the only way to cut Hamas off at the knees is to deliver that two-state solution, because that ultimately is the security answer for both Palestine and Israel.”
Moran visited Israel last year with the Lib Dems Friends of Israel.
“We wanted to understand better the political sphere in Israel, and the Jewish diaspora in this country and how they connect. And I think that has also brought me a much better understanding of myself, understanding the Israeli narrative of their past as a parallel narrative to the Palestine narrative, and understanding that for those peoples both are right. 
“75 years this year marks both the biggest catastrophe for the Palestine people, when thousands were killed and millions displaced, and at the same time for Jewish people it is the year of hope, when finally they found their safe haven after thousands of years of persecution.”
On her desk is a memoir written by her great-grandfather Wasif Jawhariyyeh, The Storyteller of Jerusalem, describing life in the city from the years of the Ottoman Empire to the British Mandate. An important figure in the city’s Greek Orthodox community, he was employed by the British to help them govern at the time of the Mandate.  
“One of the beauties of this book,” Moran says, “is that it reminds us that Jews, Muslims, Christians once lived side by side in brotherhood, in laughter; they shared each other’s holidays. We have so much more in common. There was a version of a shared history that does exist, that we don’t tell.
“I believe Palestinians should learn the Israeli history, alongside their own, without diminishing their own, and vice versa. And that is how you will start to bridge that understanding.”
Understanding also seems to be something that is thin on the ground in Britain, where the situation risks becoming even more incendiary.
“If we don’t start to change the narrative to help to calm things down,” Moran says, “then there is a fear this is going to lead to very bad places here on the streets. We have seen record numbers of complaints made to the police both for anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and we have to appreciate that fear they feel is very real, and we all have a role to play in calming that.”
People tearing down the posters of Israeli hostages is “disgusting,” she says. “I have condemned that.” And police in Manchester and London (where the Met explained officers were taking steps ‘to avoid community tension’) doing the same thing, is “not helpful”.
Nor, she believes, is Suella Braverman, talking of “hate marches”.
People chanting “from the river to the sea”, she says, “are often referring to the ‘67 borders. They are not suggesting the elimination of Israel. But that is the interpretation by some, and I think that people shouldn’t say that if it’s going to cause that kind of offence.
“Are there people on the extremes who purposely choose to hijack [marches]? Absolutely. But anyone supporting Hamas should be arrested. That’s clear.”
Does she think police have been robust enough in enforcing the law on this?
“I can only comment on where I have had direct contact with them, and that is the police in Oxfordshire, who have taken an incredibly sensitive approach to this and have gone out of their way to reassure the Jewish community there – as have I – that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them.”
The day after I met Moran she was attending a candlelit peace vigil in Oxford, that would be attended by more than 200 people; a drop in the ocean compared with the hundreds of thousands marching on the streets of Britain’s cities.
“We are here from all faiths and none to lean on each other,” Moran told the crowd. “We don’t have to accept divisive narratives – we can choose to stick to the side of humanity.” 
“You have to look for hope,” she tells me, “you have to look for light, and the only thing I can reach for is, out of all this, has to come an effort on the part of the whole of the world that we never want to see this again.”
Like every other MP she has spoken to, the issue has brought her the biggest postbag ever from her constituents. 
“The way it has captured the hearts and minds of the British public is extraordinary – and by and large they also reject those extremes, and want to come together in solidarity and peace. And I feel it’s my responsibility to speak to that.”
But at the same time, she adds, she is an MP, and the other part of the day job doesn’t stop. For the first time in our conversation she allows herself a laugh. “The Botley Interchange on the A34 is never far from my mind.”"

Multiple stars feature in cache of screenshots sent to broadcaster weeks ago yet many posts have not been deleted
Multiple presenters on a BBC radio station have been accused of posting “toxic” and “anti-Israel” content on social media about the Israel-Hamas war, The Telegraph can reveal.
This newspaper has seen evidence that influential stars from BBC’s Asian Network have shared disputed claims to thousands of followers.
One presenter shared an image with the slogan “From the river to the sea”, which has previously been described by Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, as a “staple of anti-Semitic discourse”.
The Telegraph has analysed a cache of screenshots, shared by a concerned listener, collated since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct 7 that show Asian Network presenters accusing Israel of committing genocide, sharing conspiracy theory videos and encouraging followers to attend pro-Palestine marches.
BBC bosses were alerted to concerns about the social media accounts about three weeks after Hamas’s attacks on Israel.
Yet on Wednesday, while some of the posts have been deleted, several of the highlighted posts remain online.
Less than two weeks ago, one presenter shared a video that accused Israel of using “atrocity propaganda”, while suggesting that Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, was against a ceasefire because it was in his father-in-law’s financial interests for conflict to continue.
It comes as the BBC faces mounting pressure about its reporting of the conflict and amid questions on the use of social media by BBC employees.
Last month, Ahmed Hussain, the head of the Asian Network, reportedly breached the broadcaster’s social media rules by sharing a comedian’s tweet that described military actions in Gaza as a “genocide”.
It is understood that his tweet was considered to break the rules because he is a “senior leader”.
Under BBC guidelines, staff in such positions, as well as those in news, current affairs and factual journalism, have to abide by its strictest rules on impartiality.
However, other employees are not covered by the guidelines.
And all staff are expected to “respect high standards of civility in public discourse and to not bring the BBC into disrepute”.
Last night, Danny Cohen, a former BBC executive, said that the tweets and posts by Asian Network presenters showed that the guidelines were “not fit for purpose”.
He accused senior management at the broadcaster of being “either complicit in anti-Israel bias” or having “lost control of their own staff and the content they produce”.
Writing for The Telegraph, Mr Cohen, who was director of BBC Television from 2013 to 2015, said: “Since the Hamas terrorist attacks, licence-fee paid BBC presenters with large online followings have accused Israel of genocide, ethnic cleansing and war crimes and have encouraged people to attend marches at which anti-Semitism has been on open display.”
The Lineker loophole
Gary Lineker caused a row in March when he took to Twitter in response to the Government’s immigration policy.

He also added that it was “clear that the latest social media guidelines issued by the BBC director-general just weeks ago are not fit for purpose”.
The social media accounts analysed include those of Noreen Khan, the award-winning TV and radio presenter.
Hours after the Oct 7 attacks, in which Hamas launched a surprise assault on Israel killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage in Gaza, Ms Khan retweeted an account on X, formerly known as Twitter, showing a map claiming how Palestinian territory had shrunk. The caption read: “A casual reminder. #FreePalestine.”
Addressing the post, Mr Cohen said: “As families were being burnt alive in their homes, women raped and children kidnapped, Khan felt that this was not a moment for sympathy for Jewish suffering, but an opportunity for a BBC employee to use her platform to make an anti-Israel statement.
“In doing so she came perilously close to attempting to justify horrific acts of terrorism still taking place at that very time.”
The Israeli government has launched numerous air strikes on Palestine since the attacks, and has sent soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to carry out on ground operations.
More than 14,500 people have been killed in Palestine since Oct 7, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
Hashu Mohammed, a DJ and comedian who goes by the name SMASHBengali, shared a video that suggested Mr Sunak was refusing to vote for a ceasefire for financial reasons.
In the video, a man who claims to be a “medical doctor and pharmacist” suggests that Mr Sunak’s father-in-law is financially benefiting from the conflict because of lucrative contracts to drill for oil in the area being signed between BP and a company founded by the billionaire Narayana Murthy.
The doctor, who states in his bio that “I will spread the truth”, also said that there was “a lot of atrocity propaganda”, adding: “Objective is to get the world on side to dehumanise the Palestinians and allow the world to see mass genocide and ethnic cleansing without any objections from the world.”
Crediting the video and sharing the clip on his Facebook page, Mr Mohammed wrote: “Definitely isn’t just about ‘eliminating Hamas’.”
Mr Mohammed, 31, also shared a short video that showed him shouting into a megaphone amid a bustling crowd of pro-Palestinian protesters.
In a separate clip, shared as an Instagram story, he appeared to lead a chant of: “One, two, three, four, occupation’s not a war.”
In a different Instagram story from another user’s account shared to his 101,000 followers, a photograph of Mr Mohammed standing among other demonstrators was captioned with: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ [Palestine flag emoji].”
He has also shared dates and locations of pro-Palestine protests on his Facebook page.
While the majority who attend demonstrations in support of Palestine do so peacefully, some attendees have been seen carrying explicitly anti-Semitic signs and others have been charged after displaying pro-Hamas imagery.
Like Mr Hussain, Mr Mohammed also describes military action in Gaza as a “genocide” – a term also repeatedly used by the presenter Mehreen Baig, who shared a Washington Post article via an Instagram story that described how more than a million people had been told to evacuate northern Gaza within 24 hours.
Captioning the article, she wrote: “We are watching an occupied, oppressed people face annihilation by a nuclear state with the full backing of the Western world.
“This is not – and has never been – an ‘equal fight’. This is genocide. It is utterly inhumane.”
In another Instagram story, Ms Baig also shared an image of a tweet in which an author replied to a tweet that asked “What’s the weirdest rebranding of all time?” with the response: “Genocide as self defence.”
‘A profound system failure’
Ms Baig also appeared to show that she knew her content could put her career at risk – in another Instagram story, she wrote: “I’d rather be cancelled than be controlled.”
The concerned listener first contacted Lorna Clarke, the director of music at the BBC, on Oct 26 and continued to raise concerns about the BBC Asian Network’s presenters posting “politically biased” content on their social media accounts.
The Telegraph has seen copies of the correspondence, in which the listener included a link to the cache of screenshots, adding: “What has happened at Asian Network is not OK, and I hope you can take steps to remedy the problem.”
That same day, Ms Clarke replied to the whistleblower’s offer of a phone call, saying: “I have the allegations below and have been brought up to date with your previous correspondence with the BBC so as you say it will be looked into.”
On Oct 31, following further correspondence, she sent another message responding to the whistleblower, saying: “Thank you we continue to monitor.”
Mr Cohen, who has previously called for an independent review into the BBC’s coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, said that the broadcaster now faces a “genuine crisis” about the BBC’s Asian Network presenters posting “toxic” and “incendiary, deeply offensive and anti-Israel material online”.
He also accused the BBC of “a profound system failure”, adding that the fact Ms Clarke was warned about these posts “means that senior management is either complicit in anti-Israel bias at the BBC or has lost control of their own staff and the content they produce”.
The BBC made changes to its social media guidelines earlier this year after the Match of the Day host Gary Lineker provoked a row with a post on Twitter, since rebranded to X, in which he compared the language of Mrs Braverman to “Germany in the 30s”.
Under the updated guidance, designed to make clear which employees are covered by impartiality rules, presenters on a list of “flagship brand” programmes, including Match of the Day, must adhere to tighter restrictions than other presenters.
Lord Polak, the honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel, told The Telegraph: “The BBC is in a mess – much of which is of its own making. The number of times an apology has been made or a post deleted since October 7 has made the BBC unreliable and partisan. Only this weekend Jeremy Bowen admitted he made a mistake but did not apologise. It is therefore little wonder that BBC Asian network despite warnings over the past month has done precious little to ensure that the network is politically neutral.”
‘Important BBC maintains impartiality’
Speaking in a television interview last week, Mr Bowen, the international editor of BBC News, said that he was incorrect to have suggested Al-Ahli hospital “was flattened” in an explosion on Oct 17.
Hamas claimed that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 500 people in the blast – while the IDF said that the blast had been caused by a misfired rocket from the Palestinian terrorist group Islamic Jihad.
The British Government later concluded that the Israeli version of events was more likely to be correct, while later reports found that the hospital building was intact and any explosion had centred on the car park.
When asked about his initial report, Mr Bowen told the BBC’s Behind the Stories programme: “That was my conclusion from looking at the pictures and I was wrong on that, but I don’t feel particularly bad about that.
“It was just the conclusion I drew.”
Sir Michael Ellis, the former attorney general, said: “It is crucially important that the BBC maintains due impartiality across its networks and expects high standards from all of its on-air broadcasting team no matter what channel they’re on.
“The BBC’s reputation has already suffered badly as a consequence of their biased coverage of this conflict and it’s in the national interest that the BBC management require their staff to maintain proper standards. Those standards should obviously include their presenters not taking sides in an international conflict.”
A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: “We are deeply concerned by highly politicised statements made by a number of presenters and DJ’s on the BBC Asian network, relating to Israel’s response to the Hamas terror attacks.
He added: “We hope that the corporation will now treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves.”
Earlier this month, Tim Davie, the director-general of the BBC, urged staff to “think carefully about the language” they used “in person, on email and on social media” to ensure others did not face “fear or prejudice” in the workplace.
It is understood that the BBC is in ongoing conversation with staff regarding civility and that it assesses all complaints about potential breaches of its social media policy.
A spokesman for the broadcaster declined to comment when approached by The Telegraph.
Ms Khan declined to comment.
Spokesmen for Mr Mohammed and Ms Baig did not respond to requests for comment."

A Hamas leader specialising in kidnappings and cross-border infiltration who was pronounced dead in 2014, is alive and masterminded the Oct 7 attacks, Israeli spies believe.
Sources close to Israeli intelligence said Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of Yahya Sinwa, Hamas’s leader in Gaza and Israel’s most-wanted terrorist, has been living under a shroud of secrecy in the tunnels beneath the Strip for years.
They say he was closely involved with the planning of the attack last month that killed 1,200 people, hoping that hundreds of people taken hostage could be used to secure the release of some 5,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails.
“He was 100 per cent one of the core team who planned Oct 7,” a former Mossad counter-terror chief told  the Telegraph, describing a group of three to four key figures behind the deadly attack.
“In the military leadership he’s very important,” the source said. “He’s around number seven on the wanted list, alongside the likes of Mohammed Deif, Marwan Issa and Tawfiq Abu Naim. He’s an important figure and he’s still alive for sure.”Israeli spies believe Mohammed Sinwar has been hiding in tunnels beneath Gaza for years
The younger Sinwar, who helped free his brother from an Israeli jail in a landmark prisoner exchange in 2011, “is considered one of the main brains in planning the invasion, massacre and mass kidnapping of the Israelis from the surrounding settlements,” said Ronen Solomon, an independent intelligence analyst and author of the Intelli Times blog.
“His speciality is border infiltration and kidnappings for [securing] the release of all prisoners,” said Mr Solomon, who has been following Mohammed for more than two decades, amassing an archive of documents, photographs and interviews that help to shine some light on the notoriously secretive figure.
Such is the secrecy surrounding Mohammed, that even residents of Gaza no longer recognise him, he said.
“He moved secretly and within a limited range, for fear of being exposed to an Israeli assassination,” said Mr Solomon. “During the last two decades, he survived six assassination attempts.”
Israeli forces destroyed Mohammed’s family home on Oct 24 2004 after he went to ground following a failed assassination attempt in 2003.
Ten years later, at the height of the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, the terrorist group pronounced him dead, releasing an image showing him lying on a blood-stained bed.
Faking Mohammed’s death was part of a mission to protect one of Hamas’s three “shadow commanders,” said Mr Solomon.
Since then, he has never been seen in public, appearing only in silhouette in an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic in May last year. He did not even attend the funeral of his father in January 2022.
But the Israeli military quietly revealed it was hunting him once again this week, when Mohammed’s picture appeared alongside that of his brother during a briefing by Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defence minister. He did not mention him by name or go into detail about his involvement in the October attack.
Separately, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that soldiers of  the 7th Brigade had raided offices linked to Mohammed, where they found “documentation of military doctrine”.
After Yahya Sinwar was released along with more than 1,000 other prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011, Mohammed remained in the shadows.
The former Mossad counter-intelligence chief said he was instrumental in securing his brother’s release from prison and then orchestrated his rise to power in Gaza.
“Mohammed was always more important than his brother. He was the person who initiated and held Gilad Shalit,” the source said. “He was the one who created the list of prisoners in Israel to be released and of course, Yahya, was number one.”
Until that time, Yahya was not even considered a part of the Hamas leadership, the source said.
When Mohammed created the list, many in Hamas objected to the fact that Yahya was put at the top.
“Mohammed was not negotiating on that fact and said, if you object to my list, I’m going to take Shalit to the seashore, I will behead him and video it, so, they backed off and Yahya became the most important one.”
This move would prove transformative for Yahya Sinwar, who would eventually take over from Ismail Haniyeh, now Hamas’s political leader in exile in Qatar, in 2017.
“He received a hero’s welcome when he returned to Gaza and very soon, he rose to become a prominent leader and succeeded Haniyeh.”
But Mohammed remains a prominent figure in his own right. He was one of the first generation to join the ranks of Hamas since its inception on Dec 14, 1987, and took part in the first intifada.
After rising through the ranks in various administrative positions, he was one of the first to join the military arm of Hamas, the Izz al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades. In 2005 he became the commander of the Khan Younis Brigade.
Mohammed has long been a prime target for Israel’s military and intelligence agencies.
On April 11, 2003, the Al-Qassam Brigades said that Mohammed had survived an assassination attempt using an explosive device planted in the wall of his house in the city of Khan Younis.
But Israeli spies believe Mohammed has now been given the responsibility of protecting his brother, who Israel has described as a “dead man walking”.
“It is believed that he is now also entrusted with ensuring the safety and escape of his brother Yahya through Rafah if required,” said Mr Solomon."

Also, as a veteran, I believe tomorrow's London march should be allowed
The shock of the atrocities in Israel on 7th October still reverberates across the world.  As we watch the Israeli response, praying that they will act proportionally, we must consider why this is happening and what happens next.
Hamas, a terrorist organisation affiliated to the hardline Sunni Muslim Brotherhood is, bizarrely, funded, trained and mentored by the extremist Shi’ite regime in Tehran. Indeed Hamas (Harakat al Muqawamah al Islamiyah) was, along with Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of the jewels in the crown of terror assembled by the late Major General Qassim Soleimani, who was head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) special ‘al-Quds’ force responsible for Islamist subversion worldwide. Soleimani was killed in a targeted US drone strike directed specifically at him in 2020, during a visit to Baghdad.
The reason for the attack on 7th October can be found in the increasing concern with which the regime in Tehran watched the building rapprochement between Israel and the Saudis and other Gulf nations (with the exception of Qatar). As the discussion of a strengthened two state solution in Palestine/Israel gathered pace it was clear that the realisation of such a settlement would isolate the Iranians and reduce the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. The attack, almost certainly planned in Iran, rehearsed in Syria and prepared in great secrecy, took everyone by surprise. The resulting Israeli reaction has been criticised far more than the original act and this is no doubt a source of satisfaction to both the IRGC and the Muslim Brotherhood.
International reaction has been complex.  The shuttle diplomacy of the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been hampered by boycotts from regional allies as well as outright support for the atrocities by Turkey’s President Erdogan, whose AKP Party is part of the Muslim Brotherhood. Events such as the bombing of the Al Ahli hospital, blamed on the Israelis by Hamas whose lies were reported as fact by media outlets including the BBC (which later acknowledged that it was as the result of a missile launch internal to Gaza) exacerbated the issue. In that case at least, Hamas appears not only to have wrongly blamed Israel but to have exaggerated the number of civilian casualties massively.
When reading media reports of civilian casualties in Gaza it is important to remember that the only source of numbers is Hamas: the “Palestinian health ministry” is part of the terrorist organisation. The UN, too, simply repeats Hamas numbers. This is not to say that the Israeli Defence Forces are not killing civilians: it is merely to point out that Hamas has every reason to exaggerate the extent to which they are doing so.
Meanwhile, eager to compete on the world stage China has entered the diplomatic fray and has in addition dispatched six warships to the region. Having brokered the historic meeting between the foreign minister of Saudi and that of Iran recently, China will unavoidably have a role to play in the diplomatic fallout of this crisis.
What of the future? The Israelis are making it clear that they do not want a lasting presence in post-conflict Gaza. The obvious solution would be a pan-Arab peace keeping force that would, as well as policing Gaza, be needed in the wider Palestinian Authority. If things turn out well, it could even be that the events of October 7th inadvertently bring forward a two-state solution with Arab forces guaranteeing the borders of the Palestinian state. This would require the removal of all of the illegal Israeli settlements established within the Palestinian Authority.  It would also serve to bolster the regime of Mahmoud Abas, the president of Palestine (now in the eighteenth year of his four-year term).
The task of the potential Pan-Arab Force would be daunting.  It could not include troops from Qatar, the former mentor and primary funder of Gaza, because of its close affiliations to the Muslim Brotherhood. Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi, the Brotherhood’s spiritual leader, resides in Doha where he is treated with great reverence, and the head office of Hamas is also located in Qatar. A peacekeeping force in Gaza would most likely be led by Egypt and other Gulf nations. Whilst it would be welcomed in the West Bank it would be under constant challenge and even attack by Iranian and Muslim Brotherhood elements in the area. It would need significant western – and even Israeli – intelligence support to fulfil its role.
In the meantime, the future is dependent on the behaviour and to a great degree the success of the Israeli counter-offensive. With both Chinese and US warships in the region the danger of an unintentional confrontation or violent encounter is a real danger. To the delight of Russia, the crisis has distracted the world gaze from the illegal invasion of Ukraine and provided a temporary respite in the diplomatic pressure on them, not to mention the additional prospect of US military aid being diverted to Israel.
Tehran is also benefiting from the crisis. With an increasingly fractured and unpopular regime trying desperately to hold back the future in Iran, the mullahs need an external threat in order to unite a most unhappy nation. Ironically, so threatened are they by internal discord it is most unlikely that their Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon will attack Israel as they are a vital reserve force for the decrepit Iranian regime. 
Elsewhere, significant disruption and the potential for violence has reached Europe – even here in the UK with the pro Palestine march planned for 11th November causing controversy and disquiet. In my opinion, speaking as a veteran myself, the march should be allowed to go ahead. Those we remember at the eleventh hour gave their lives to preserve our freedoms, and the freedom to march in the streets in an orderly fashion is one of them. Our government should take every care, however, to ensure the march is not exploited by the Muslim Brotherhood, or any one of its many UK based affiliates, to divide our nation and threaten any section of our population, most particularly those of a Jewish background."

Prof Ilan Pappé also said he ‘condemned’ the Oct 7 attacks ‘now more than ever before’
A professor at a Russell Group university said in the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct 7 that the terror group “had to act, and quickly so”.
In a separate interview, Prof Ilan Pappé also denied that Hamas, which killed about 1,200 people and took hundreds of men, women and children hostage, was a “terrorist” movement.
The expatriate Israeli historian is professor of history and director of the European Centre for Palestinian Studies at the University of Exeter.
It is the latest UK university to face scrutiny over the views of its staff on the Israel-Hamas war.
A student accused the university of “failing to support” its Jewish community by not immediately condemning the academic’s comments.
In a comment piece published on the The Palestine Chronicle website on Oct 10, Prof Pappé, 69, described how it was “challenging to maintain one’s moral compass” when society “takes the moral high ground and expects you to share with them the same righteous fury with which they reacted to the events of last Saturday, October 7”.
He added: “It is this moral compass that led me, and others in our society, to stand by the Palestinian people in every way possible; and that enables us, at the same time, to admire the courage of the Palestinian fighters who took over a dozen military bases, overcoming the strongest army in the Middle East.
“Also, people like me cannot avoid but raise questions about the moral or strategic value of some of the actions that accompanied this operation.”
When asked to clarify whether he “admired” the courage of the Hamas fighters who stormed kibbutzim to murder and rape civilians, Prof Pappé stressed that he “condemned” these attacks “now more than ever before”. He added: “There is a difference between occupying military bases of an army that maintains the Gaza Strip as a ghetto and the killing of innocent people, raping and the other atrocities committed that awful Saturday.”
In the same article, Prof Pappé went on to describe the plight of Palestinian people “at a time when its oppressors had elected a government, which is hellbent on accelerating… the elimination of the Palestinian people”. He added: “Hamas had to act, and quickly so.”
The renowned academic also called for “de-Zionised, liberated and democratic” Palestine “from the river to the sea”.
The phrase has been chanted by Palestinian nationalists and terror groups to assert territorial claims of an independent Palestinian state.
However, Prof Pappé told The Telegraph that the slogan was for “Jews and Palestinians who believe that the only solution to the conflict is one democratic state all over Palestine and Israel” and that if anyone thought it was racist then the problem “lies in their understanding”.
In a separate TV interview with news channel Al Jazeera, Prof Pappé was asked whether he agreed that Hamas was “not a terrorist movement”?
‘National liberation movement’
In an exchange translated from Arabic, Prof Pappé responded: “No, it is not” before agreeing that it was “a national liberation and resistance movement”.
The academic told The Telegraph he recognised and “respected” Hamas as a “proscribed terror organisation under British law”, but added: “I explained that I understand this is the law but I think it is wrong as an expert.”
Rojin-Sena Cantay, 20, an Exeter student, said she reported the academic’s comments in the interview to the university after seeing a clip online.
Ms Cantay claimed that Exeter staff told her they would need to look into it themselves and ensure they had accurate translations of what Prof Pappé had said and she had not heard anything else since.
She said: “I am absolutely terrified to think of how people around campus who respect this professor will be influenced by him.
“I do feel the university has failed to support its Jewish community. At the very least they could put out a statement publicly condemning Hamas as a show of support for us.”
Ms Cantay is a fellow for the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera).
Christina Jones, a spokesperson for Camera UK, said: “It is shocking a professor at a leading UK university would attempt to downplay the events of Oct 7.
“Hamas is a terrorist organisation with no moral compass that openly calls for the genocide of Jews in its charter and that has acted upon this edict.”
Edward Isaacs, president of the UK and Ireland’s Union of Jewish Students, said: “It is sickening and completely unacceptable for Prof Pappé to praise the ‘courage’ of Hamas terrorists on Oct 7.”
‘I explain how Hamas felt’
When asked whether he was justifying the attacks of Oct 7, Prof Pappé said: “Hamas promised two years ago to act if the Al-Aqsa Mosque was invaded and its activists continued to be arrested and killed and if the siege continued.
“It had to act according to its own understanding of prestige and survival. That does not mean that I justify its action; as an expert I explain how they felt and they felt they had to act.”
As part of a lengthy response he also said it was a “sensitive time” for Palestinians in Britain, as well as Jews, and that students were “always welcome to talk to him directly”.
He added: “I have taught Jewish, Arab and British students for 15 years in Exeter. Even Jewish students who disagreed with me felt that they were treated fairly and found the course professional and illuminating.”
A University of Exeter spokesperson said: “We remain deeply concerned and distressed by the violence in Israel, Palestine and the Middle East. Our thoughts are with all those who are suffering as a result, wherever they are in the world.  
“The University’s primary role is to ensure the safety of our students and colleagues, and to safeguard the freedom of speech and expression and academic freedom for all members of our community. 
“We promote a culture of debate within the law, built on the principle of tolerance of different views and beliefs. We actively promote free discussion and interrogation of challenging and sometimes controversial ideas, and ensure that our academic staff are able to undertake teaching and research without hindrance of their right to freedom of speech beyond the limitations of the law.”
They added: “We received reports of an incident during a student event on campus. We offered support to the affected students, and investigated the incident fully. We are unambiguous in our support for all colleagues and students at this time, and there is no place for hate in our community.”"

Concerns about report on blast at Al-Ahli hospital and other new bulletins were raised by law firm acting for two Jewish groups
The BBC has not upheld a number of complaints raised about its reporting of the Israel-Hamas war following an investigation.
Concerns about a report on Oct 17 in relation to the blast at Al-Ahli hospital as well as other news bulletins were raised by the law firm Mishcon de Reya on behalf of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA).
Tim Davie, the director-general of the BBC, referred the complaints to the corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU), which considered them in light of their “editorial standards of accuracy and impartiality”.
It comes as BBC employees have reportedly been banned from attending a march against anti-Semitism on Sunday.
Both organisations complained that the BBC news show The Context “wrongly attributed” the air strike at Al-Ahli hospital to the Israeli military, which Israel has suggested was caused by a rocket misfired by Palestinian militants.
During the show, Jon Donnison, a BBC correspondent reporting from Jerusalem, said: “Now the Israeli Defense Forces, the Israeli military, have been contacted for comment and they have said that they are investigating.
“But, you know, it’s hard to see what else this could be, really, given the size of the explosion, other than an Israeli airstrike or several air strikes, because, you know, when we’ve seen rockets being fired out of Gaza, we never see explosions of that scale.”
The ECU stated that the complaint has been “resolved” because it judged that Mr Donnison had made it clear to viewers that the Israeli military had not made any “substantive comment”, and although he had stated there was a “strong probability of Israeli involvement”, it deemed that he had not offered a “definitive judgment”.
However, it accepted that it was “not consistent with the BBC’s standards of due accuracy to offer any view about responsibility for the incident at a point where so little reliable information was available”.
The complaints unit noted that BBC News had posted a statement on their corrections and clarifications page stating that Mr Donnison was “wrong to speculate” on the causes of the blast and an apology was added to the statement when the latest ruling was published.
The CAA also complained about a tweet, push notification and post in relation to the reporting of the events of Oct 17.
The ECU did not uphold the complaints about inaccuracy in the report as it referred to BBC Verify’s coverage and stated that “the BBC cannot yet establish as fact who was responsible for the blast”.
Another complaint that was not upheld questioned the BBC’s impartiality in relation to the broadcaster not using the term “terrorist” in relation to Hamas.
The Board of Deputies argued that use of “terms as ‘bomber’, ‘attacker’, ‘gunman’, ‘kidnapper’, ‘insurgent’ and ‘militant’ fell short” because they did not “convey the full horror” of Hamas’s actions on Oct 7.
The ECU accepted that none of these terms on their own conveyed the full horror of the actions but added that there was “room for doubt” that even the word “terrorist” did this.
It added that it was the reporting of Hamas’s actions, rather than the terminology, “that was the test of whether justice has been done to the events”.
A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC is clear that anti-Semitism is abhorrent.
“We have established guidance around marches, which explains that different considerations apply depending on what you do for the BBC.

The corporation is now a national broadcasting disservice
Last week, the BBC’s Executive Complaints Unit refused to uphold complaints about the BBC News Channel’s coverage of the situation in Gaza, including its serious propagation of false information about the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City on 17 October 2023.
Effectively acting as a mouthpiece for the Hamas terrorist organisation, BBC News outlets ran with variations on “hundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli air strike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say”. The caveat of the source for this claim being Hamas was lost entirely as commentators mused on the frequency of Israeli war crimes and alleged that Israel habitually targets civilians. The disinformation from the “trusted” BBC was further disseminated by high-profile individuals, including the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
The BBC’s subsequent walk-back from its initial reporting has involved gross misrepresentations of what was actually said, and what BBC officials claim was meant by it. The explanation the network finally offered did not even address its most disturbing failure. It shunned its responsibility for wilfully broadcasting false information when it had been warned. I know because I was there.
I was booked for an interview at 19:00 that evening to address and analyse the application of the law of armed conflict to the developing situation. At 19.10, while waiting on the line for the live broadcast, I received a call from an assistant editor of the BBC News Channel, to tell me they would have to “bump” me off to run with the rolling coverage of the “Israeli airstrike” on the hospital. He was apologetic, and insistent that I would be invited back as soon as possible. Thus began my bid to appeal to reason, common sense and basic journalistic integrity. 
I had been watching the coverage that evening already in disbelief. I explained that now, more than ever, the channel needed me on to provide balance. There was a desperate need to keep to the BBC’s commitments of due accuracy and impartiality. I had already seen many online reports that the incident had occurred in the context of a barrage of rockets from Gaza towards Israeli civilian communities. The BBC’s line simply didn’t add up. 
I explained: there are things we don’t know and things we do know. At this moment, we don’t know who or what hit that hospital (it later transpired to be only the car park that was hit). We do know, however, that, unlike Hamas, Israel does not target civilian or protected individuals or buildings. 
We know that Hamas and other Palestinian terror organisations keep weapons caches in and around schools and hospitals. We know that the rockets they fire towards Israel frequently fall short in Gaza, indiscriminately killing civilians there. We knew by then also that the BBC had, a few days previously, similarly wrongly attributed the bombing of a civilian convoy evacuating to the south of Gaza (US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan had earlier that day confirmed that this had been a Hamas attack). 
I appealed to reason. I could predict the impact that spreading disinformation about the hospital would have on the Arab world, incited as it was in the hours that followed to riot by these false reports. 
My pleas, though I was informed they were relayed up to the editor himself, fell on deaf ears. Reports of a rocket barrage towards Israel were not being seen on any of the wires, came the retort. I was told the BBC’s story had been confirmed by multiple sources. Yet we know that any “Palestinian official” in Gaza is a Hamas official, and not a source that any self-respecting journalist can take seriously. Parroting Hamas propaganda is not journalism. The call ended abruptly. I was told there wasn’t time to discuss this further. 
The false allegation of Israeli war crimes continued. The damage it has done is irreversible. 
I maintained a naïve hope that, with further opportunities to address this disinformation on air, the truth would out. But after my interview the next week with Katya Adler, I was stonewalled by BBC producers and executives, and their promotion of Hamas propaganda has continued. 
The consequences of its coverage are plain and on regular display in the hate marches on the streets of the UK. The Met Police recorded an increase of over 1,000 per cent in anti-Semitic hate crimes in October. The BBC has become a national broadcasting disservice.

If they truly cared about Palestinians and the loss of innocent life, they’d surely be protesting Hamas
To be a Jew in Britain today is to feel as if we have truly stepped through the looking glass. It has been almost a month since Hamas violently massacred 1,400 innocent civilians in southern Israel on Oct 7, torturing families next to their Shabbat tables, raping women among the bodies of their dead friends and murdering children and babies.
In the days after 260 people were murdered at a music festival, we expected there may be vigils similar to those held after 90 people were murdered at the Bataclan concert in Paris, 49 were shot at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando or 22 killed at the Manchester Arena concert bombing.
When more than 240 people – among them defenceless pensioners, children and babies – were taken hostage into terrorist territory, we assumed the calls for their return would be deafening. Tens of thousands of people in Britain and other Western countries did indeed pour into the streets, but not to grieve. Many chose to celebrate and glorify these brutal atrocities. These marches are now a regular occurrence in London – and this weekend, again, they donned their keffiyehs, waved their flags and called for Palestine to be freed.
Freed from what? From Hamas, the autocratic, racist, sexist, homophobic, terrorist death cult that won power in 2006 and has refused to give it up since? Freed from the corrupt, wealthy politicians who count their millions abroad while half their people live in decades-old refugee camps? Freed from Gazan leaders who squandered the opportunity to control their own borders after Israel’s disengagement in 2005 and have repeatedly rejected the offers of peace and land that would create an autonomous Palestinian state?
No, those injustices are all ignored. “Pro-Palestinians”, particularly many Westerners with no skin in the game, are not interested in the plight of Palestinians unless the perceived perpetrator is Israel. They don’t love Palestinians, they just hate Israel. And make no mistake: they hate Israel because they hate Jews.
If they cared about Palestinians, they would hold Hamas responsible for hoarding water and fuel and building its terrorist infrastructure behind schools, hospitals and homes. If they cared about genocide, they would march in their thousands for the victims of horrors happening right now in Sudan, Congo, Yemen and Azerbaijan. If they cared about children, they would demand the return of the hostages, not pull down posters of missing babies.
Instead, they chant for Palestine to be freed “from the river to the sea”. The meaning of that catchphrase is not ambiguous. In the same breath that pro-Palestinians falsely accuse Israel of “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide”, they call for the mass murder and expulsion of an entire Jewish population. The hypocrisy is staggering.
We have been here before. As the old joke goes, all Jewish rituals can be summed up with the phrase “They tried to kill us, we survived, let’s eat.”
Jews have been exterminated or exiled from practically every place we have called home: from Samaria in 733 BCE, Judea in 586 BCE and Jerusalem in 70 CE; from England in 1290, France in 1394, Spain in 1492, Ukraine in 1648, Russia in the late 18th and early 19th century and Eastern Europe from 1933 to 1945.
The Holocaust is widely seen as the most recent major atrocity against the Jews but in the subsequent years we were also all but extinguished from the Arab world. In 1948, the year the state of Israel was created following the UN General Assembly vote – as would the state of Palestine have been, had the Arab League not rejected this proposal in favour of waging war against a fledgling Israel – there were 150,000 Jews in Iraq, 75,000 in Egypt and tens of thousands in each of Libya, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Today, there are just a few dozen Jews that still call any of these countries home; in some cases, none. More than half of Israeli Jews today are descended from these Arab families (so much for the “white coloniser” narrative). If they were forced to flee Israel, do you expect their former home countries would accept them back with open arms?
Unlike those who justify the unthinkable crimes of Hamas, Jews do not take this bleak history as motive or permission to maim or murder any of the citizens of the long list of countries that have persecuted us and destroyed our homes. Instead, we have built a barren land the size of Wales into a country that competes economically, scientifically and culturally on the world stage.
Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Its people have freedom of expression, religion and sexuality. One fifth of its citizens are Arab-Israeli, who have equal voting rights and hold senior positions in the Government and the Supreme Court. Around 18 per cent of Israelis are Muslim (so much for the “apartheid state” narrative).
But why should the Left let these facts get in the way of a bit of good Israel bashing? When “pro-Palestinians” – in the name of Liberal values and human rights – side with despotic Hamas over democratic Israel, when they accuse Israel of ethnic cleansing but legitimise the terrorists whose founding charter calls for the annihilation of Jews, when they say Israel is committing genocide yet call for its people to be wiped out, it is baffling to the point of absurdity.
A truly free Palestine is only possible when Israel can stop protecting its borders from constant attack, when Palestinian leaders prioritise their people instead of their profits and when they accept a Jewish homeland and commit to a two-state solution.
Jews want this. We want Palestinians to have a safe, prosperous homeland. We want these utterly heart-wrenching scenes in Gaza to stop.
But none of those things will be achieved by the Jew-hatred being spewed on London’s streets today. The louder people demand freedom “from the river to the sea”, the more they attack Jews in the name of Palestine, the stronger the proof that a Jewish Israel must exist.  "

The murder of Jews is being excused
On October 7th, 1,400 Israelis were murdered by throngs of Hamas terrorists who swarmed Israel’s southern border, going from house to house searching for civilians to slaughter and broadcasting their savagery for those who were unable to join in the brutality. 
The reaction in parts of the Middle East was unsurprising – a mixture of raucous cheers from civilians and endorsements or muted responses from Arab governments.
Amongst America’s progressive Left, the response wasn’t much different. Outside the established wing of the Democratic Party, the modus operandi has been to excuse, celebrate, and whitewash the crimes of Hamas. College campuses across the country have erupted in pro-Palestine protests, framing the violence as “liberation from oppression.” Meanwhile, numerous videos have emerged of individuals tearing down the posters of kidnapped Israelis, claiming the victims to be “occupiers” and “colonisers.”
Prominent progressive intellectuals, such as Judith Butler, have called for an end to Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza and warned that the “structural violence” will only continue to produce “resistance”. Similarly condemnatory comments from members of Congress’ progressive “squad” have been generated with predictable regularity.
For years, the American Left has positioned itself as giving a voice to the oppressed and offering refuge to those suffering; its response in the wake of October 7th has destroyed any uncertainty about its true moral compass. Equivocate or even excusing indiscriminate murder surrenders any vestige of moral high ground the movement once held. All that is left is the remains of Left-wing liberalism and a shell of empty syllogisms.
October 7th has shone a spotlight on a grotesque intersection of the academic Left and visceral anti-Semitism among some groups. The relationship between the two movements is symbiotic and converges on a similar hatred for Jews. The progressive paradigm of the “oppressor and oppressed” has found footing in delusional histories of the origins of the state of Israel. 
It doesn’t matter that gay men and women are murdered in Gaza and the West Bank, or that women continue to face oppression and abuse. The progressive Left has decided that effectively embracing anti-Semitism is worth it if it means maintaining fealty to the oppression industrial complex. 
Liberalism was once a combination of two principles: procedural liberalism (equal rights for all before the law) coupled with a particular sensitivity towards remedying social and economic inequalities. The “new Left” that has engulfed academia, HR departments and the United Nations cast aside the first principle in a mad quest to deliver social justice to the supposed oppressed. Now every inequality is viewed as the result of actions, real or imaginary, by the assigned “oppressor”, and never as the product of internal dysfunction within a particular society.  
Once the “oppressor” and “oppressed” have been assigned roles, the cast is fixed and immutable, remaining unresponsive to changing political, economic, and social circumstances.  And because of the racial framing of most politics in America, the initial casting of roles almost always follows perceived racial dynamics rather than of actual interactions between the parties. 
As a result, the paradigm is generally divorced from reality. Indeed, for many on the progressive Left, Israel is a “white supremacist” nation oppressing “people of colour,” despite the fact that many of Israel’s Jews are of Middle Eastern or North African descent themselves. Thus, it is no coincidence that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar once compared the Palestinian plight to the “racist killing” of George Floyd. Even the West’s enemies have picked up on how this works.
While many have expressed shock at the anti-Semitism now on display on the Left, for years now, the dominant voices in this movement have been illiberal ones. What has replaced reverence for Western liberalism is a celebration of brutal savagery, destruction, and death directed towards anyone deemed to be a member of a fixed oppressor group. 
Now, it is up to the Right to assume control of the moral high ground: to position itself as pro-civilization and anti-barbarism – and to be unafraid to use such language. We must denounce the atrocities unequivocally and unabashedly. 
The alternative consists of watching one side of the political spectrum devolve into barbarism dressed up in academic language. For the sake of civilisation, that cannot be allowed."

The Guardian’s coverage of the Hamas terror attacks was so “upsetting” a Jewish staff member has said they are planning to leave the organisation.
The employee also claimed that they felt uncomfortable in the newsroom, where fellow staff “dismissed Jewish pain”.
Writing in Jewish News, the anonymous staff member said they had raised concerns about aspects of the Guardian’s reporting.
The member of staff also claimed that colleagues laughed at a picture of an Israeli flag burning.
They wrote: “I email the editors. I tell them that my newspaper’s coverage has been upsetting.
“They tell me that their thoughts are with my family but they stand by the paper’s reporting.
“I hear colleagues complaining about the newspaper’s ‘American readers. They’re always accusing us of anti-Semitism’. They’re laughing.”
‘Inflammatory op-eds’
The Jewish News article cites an Oct 24 Guardian opinion piece by Raz Segal titled “Israel must stop weaponising the Holocaust”, along with pages allegedly featuring death counts of Palestinian but not Israelis, and references to Israelis “dying” but not “being killed”.
The Jewish News article concludes: “Now is not the time for colleagues to dismiss Jewish pain or publish inflammatory op-eds which will spark more violence.”
Claims about the newspaper come after a Jewish cartoonist for Private Eye quit the satirical publication after six years over concerns about its handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Mr Rockman said he was “disappointed” with a cover of the magazine, which stated: “This magazine may contain some criticism of the Israeli government and may suggest that killing everyone in Gaza as revenge for Hamas atrocities may not be a good long-term solution to the problems of the region.”
The cover was criticised by figures, including David Baddiel, who claimed it suggested that Jews were “throwing all their toys out of the pram” because they are “privileged”.
The Campaign Against Antisemitism group said the cover “plays on anti-Semitic tropes like outsized Jewish power"

A former Hamas chief is behind one of the groups organising the pro-Palestine Armistice Day protests, The Telegraph can disclose.
Muhammad Kathem Sawalha led the proscribed terrorist group in the West Bank in the late 1980s and is alleged to have “masterminded” its military strategy with involvement as recently as 2019, before moving to Britain where he lives in a London council house.
He is a founder of the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), one of six groups behind the under-fire march in London on November 11, and Israeli authorities claim his son, Obada Sawalha, is now its vice-president.
The revelation comes as The Telegraph has discovered that half of the groups organising the march - who are still defying calls from the Metropolitan Police to call it off - have links to Hamas.
It has fuelled further pressure for it to be cancelled, with the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on anti-Semitism saying that it “proves that these marches are not about peace” and the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism describing this newspaper’s findings as “extremely serious”.
Sawalha, 62, worked as a director for MAB between 1999 and 2007 and helped found it, after being granted British citizenship in the early 2000s. BBC’s Panorama claimed in 2006 that he was “said to have masterminded much of Hamas’ political and military strategy”.
He now lives in a council house in Barnet, north London, but in 2004 he was named as a co-conspirator in a US indictment for having allegedly helped bankroll Hamas and he reportedly took part in an official Hamas delegation to Moscow in 2019 and served on the Hamas politburo between 2013 and 2017.
Another of the Muslim Association of Britain’s three directors, Dr Anas Altikriti, co-founded a group called the British Muslim Initiative with a senior commander in Hamas, Mohammed Sawalha, and Azzam Tamimi who has been described as a Hamas “special envoy” in Britain.
Dr Altikriti, who has lectured at Leeds University, has written columns for The Guardian defending how “Hamas supports democracy” and insisting that “the Palestinian people have chosen” Hamas “to represent them”.
A British Government review in 2015 claimed that the MAB, founded in 1997, had been “dominated” by the Muslim Brotherhood, a controversial group that the report found had made “support for Hamas” an “important priority”. Hamas’ founding charter says that it is the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Government has said association with the group is a “possible indicator of extremism”.
Meanwhile, Zaher Birawi, a leader of the Palestinian Forum in Britain - another group organising the Armistice Day march - was described in Parliament in October by Labour MP Christian Wakeford as having been “designated by Israel in 2013 as a senior Hamas operative in Europe”, currently living in Barnet, north London, not far from Sawalhi, posing what the MP described as “a serious national security risk”.
He also allegedly met Hamas’ senior political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza in 2012 and was pictured with him.
A third group organising the protest, the Friends of al-Aqsa is founded and chaired by Leicester-based optician Ismael Patel who has also visited Haniyeh in Gaza and has joined the Gaza flotilla. According to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, the Friends of al-Aqsa is “harbouring an intense hatred for Israel, campaigning for its elimination, denying its Jewish character, and supporting Hamas”.
According to the Jewish Chronicle, he was filmed at a rally in 2009 saying: “Hamas is no terrorist organisation. The reason they hate Hamas is because they refuse to be subjugated, to be occupied by the Israeli state, and we salute Hamas for standing up to Israel.”
Responding to The Telegraph’s findings, Andrew Percy, APPG on anti-Semitism, said: “The involvement of these people proves that these marches are not about peace, they are about stirring up Jew-hate and a hatred of Western values.
“They are organised to celebrate the murder of innocent civilians in the most grotesque ways, including ripping out babies from pregnant mothers, cutting off limbs of children and worse still. These people have no interest in peace and it is time the UK stopped indulging their hateful ideology.”
Calling on the police to step in and ban the march, Mr Percy added: “The Met need to prove that they are here to defend the values of the majority in this country - not pander to a perverted ideology - by banning this hate march.”
The Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “These findings are extremely serious, and demand investigation by the authorities. Is it any wonder at the level of anti-Semitic hatred and calls for violence that we have seen at these marches if these are the organisers?
“These revelations are all the more reason for the Met Police to heed our call and ban this weekend’s march. London cannot become a no-go zone for British Jews, yet again, on Armistice Day. What a disgrace that would be to the heroes who fought for our freedom to leave without fear.”
The Community Security Trust told The Telegraph: “On October 7, Hamas finally achieved its long-stated intention to kill as many Jews as possible.
“This barbarism did not cause any change or hesitation in the actions of anti-Israel hate groups, which continue now, exactly as they always do: with calls that most Jews regard as demands for the destruction of Israel, even if they are couched in ways that just about remain within the law.”
The Muslim Association of Britain, the Palestinian Forum in Britain and the Friends of al-Aqsa have been contacted for comment."

The UN's silence on the rape of Israeli women makes a mockery of its campaign against violence
Organisations set up for the protection of women should condemn rape with equal conviction whomever the victim
Every year, to mark this campaign, Israel’s First Lady Michal Herzog invites Israeli women – Jews, Muslims, Christians and Druze amongst them – to mark the campaign’s launch at the President’s Residence in Jerusalem. Despite what Herzog described last week as “the inconceivable and unforgiveable silence of these organisations whan faced with the rape and murder of Israeli women”, she decided to go ahead with this annual event. But this year, as well as reeling from the shock of the massacre, Herzog described how her nation’s women were now reeling from a second shock: that of ‘betrayal’.
The depravity women suffered on October 7 is unimaginable: reports of gang rape; women, children and elderly so brutality sexually assaulted their dead bodies were found with broken pelvis bones; women with their breasts cut off; babies murdered in front of their mothers’ eyes – one pregnant woman was disemboweled, her foetus removed and killed in front of her before she herself was murdered. The horror goes on and on.
Since the war began there has been immense suffering in Gaza, too. Stories of innocent casualties of this war – both Israelis and Palestinians – are painful on a human level, whatever your views or beliefs. Which is why it’s both deeply hurtful but also immensely troubling when organisations, established specifically for the protection of women, cannot themselves acknowledge suffering on both sides of a divide. If those that pride themselves on being bastions of global justice are unable to respond with humanity, what hope do we have?
Perhaps we should expect nothing less from the UN group, given its recent appointment of Iran to chair its Human Rights Committee and its ongoing willingness to do Hamas’s PR. But some of our homegrown women’s charities have been equally dismissive and divisive. Sisters Uncut, whose ‘feministo’ states that they fight alongside “all those who experience domestic, sexual, gendered, and state violence”, have made no sound about the extreme sexual violence waged against Israeli women. They did however organise a pro-Palestinian sit-in at Liverpool Street station at the end of last month. Of course, they would say, they are not supporting the Palestinian leadership, whose charter, as well as calling for the destruction of Israel and all Jews, is not big on women’s rights. They are supporting Palestinian civilians. But it’s slightly baffling as to why they can’t sympathise with Israeli civilians – or call for the return of Israeli women and children hostages.
The list of similarly hypocritical organisations is endless – and the message is clear. All women have a right to protection against violence – other than Israeli women. To counteract that silence, Israeli tech executive Danielle Ofelia launched a campaign  #MeTooUnlessUrAJew, which is gathering momentum on social media and on Monday saw America demonstrating outside the UN headquarters. The aim is to gather 1,000,000 signatures and make one simple acknowledgement: every woman’s life is equally precious.
Whatever their political alignment, organisations set up for the protection of women should condemn rape with equal conviction whomever the victim – and to call for the safety of children and women hostages whatever their religion or race. Instead, their slim acknowledgements and silence echo louder than any words – and the subtext is ‘you deserved it’. In truth, it is the worst, most malevolent form of victim blaming – something modern feminists have worked so hard to stamp out. It’s time some of these humanitarian organisations started behaving with a little more humanity."

The corporation faced anger after it failed to call the group terrorists after the mass murders of October 7.
The BBC refuses to call Hamas terrorists because it fears angering the group and losing access to reporting, broadcaster Kirsty Young has suggested.
Young previously presented news for Channel 5 and ITV, but last year she was working for the BBC fronting Platinum Beacons: Lighting up the Jubilee, the live coverage of the celebration of the Queen’s 70-year reign, and then three months later Elizabeth II’s state funeral at Windsor Castle.
Young, who previously presented news for Channel 5 and ITV and was a Desert Island Discs and Crimewatch presenter for the BBC, praised its coverage of the Middle East war.
She said she understood the difficult position the corporation faces, including the criticism for not calling Hamas terrorists after the mass murders of October 7.
Following a storm of criticism the BBC now refers to the group running Gaza as a “proscribed terrorist organisation”.
Young, 54, said: “It’s not necessarily the BBC that is talking about the use of the word terrorism. They’re answering criticism from the outside and I guess as long as - especially when it comes to something in the Middle East - if you’re getting roughly the same amount of complaints from both sides, which they are, then you kind of know you’re doing an OK job.
“And I think this whole reporting that it is a proscribed terror organisation with reference to Hamas, then that is a legitimate stance if you want to continue to have access and to report what is happening in those places.
“Because what you don’t want to do is get thrown out of places because you’re not allowed to report any more.
“You want to have access. You know the whole point of the BBC in news terms is to show people the evidence as fairly as they possibly can.”
Speaking on Monday’s Adam Buxton podcast in an interview recorded last month, she said: “There’s a reason that people trust the BBC news site, and it’s because it was verified by three sources, and it’s because they’re the biggest news organisation in the world.”
When asked about Young’s comments, the BBC responded by referring to its previous statement saying: “We’ve set out our position on the use of language.”
In that, it had said: “Our coverage of the unprecedented assault on Israel by Hamas has made clear the nature of the atrocities committed and the impact this has had on civilians.
“Across our reporting we have explained that Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, including the UK.
“We have reflected the response from the international community to Hamas’ actions, and featured contributors who have described them as terrorists.
“We have given careful consideration to all aspects of our reporting of the Israel-Gaza conflict, both in terms of Hamas’ attacks and Israel’s response – this includes the language that we use.
“The BBC is editorially independent; our role is to explain precisely what is happening so that the public can make their own judgements.
“Our longstanding position, including during previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, has been that we do not use the term ‘terrorist’ without attribution, in line with the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines.”"

Broadcaster addresses mistake on air and says error ‘fell below usual editorial standards’
The BBC has apologised on air after a newsreader twice mistakenly claimed that Israeli forces were “targeting medical staff and Arab speakers” at Gaza’s largest hospital.
The apology came after Jewish leaders criticised the broadcaster for a “staggering lack of care”.
A clip of the broadcast showed a newsreader citing a report by news agency Reuters, which described how the IDF had confirmed it would be carrying out a “precise and targeted operation” against terror group Hamas in Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital.
Reuters had included a quote from an IDF spokesman that read: “The IDF forces include medical teams and Arabic speakers, who have undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment, with the intent that no harm is caused to the civilians.”
However, the BBC newsreader told viewers that medics and Arab speakers were being “targeted” by Israeli soldiers.
Misreported information
Speaking during what is understood to be a live broadcast, the newsreader said: “We are hearing from Reuters that is reporting that Israel, it says its forces are carrying out an carrying out an operation against Hamas in Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital and they are targeting people, including medical teams as well as Arab speakers.
“They are also saying that Israel is calling on all Hamas operatives in the hospital to surrender at this point.”
The newsreader then went on to repeat the misreported information, adding: “They are targeting ... it’s Arab speakers as well as some of the medical staff there and they are asking all Hamas operatives in that hospital to surrender.”
A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was “absolutely appalled” by the footage, adding: “At best, this shows a staggering lack of care when reporting on a highly volatile situation, which can have a knock-on effect all over the world, including in Britain, where anti-Semitic attacks have risen by more than 500 per cent since October 7th.
“Incidents like this make a mockery of the BBC’s oft-stated dedication to professionalism and impartiality.”
Shortly before 10am on Wednesday morning, a BBC newsreader addressed the issue, saying: “And now for an apology from the BBC.
“BBC news, as it covered an initial report, said Israeli forces has entered Gaza’s main hospital.
“We said that medical teams and Arab speakers were being targeted. This was incorrect and misquoted a Reuters report.
“We should have said IDF forces included medical teams and Arabic speakers for this operation.
“So we apologise for this error, which fell below our usual editorial standards. The correct version of events was broadcast minutes later.”
The Telegraph is awaiting further comment from the broadcaster.
Reuters has been approached for a comment."

Jewish families leaving synagogue on Saturday were “targeted” by pro-Palestinian demonstrators after hundreds of thousands gathered for a march on Armistice Day.
Footage circulated on social media on Saturday night showing protesters spraying green smoke, waving Palestinian flags and shouting from cars outside a synagogue on Abbey Road in St John’s Wood, north-west London.
A Jewish campaign group later confirmed it had received “multiple reports” of police having to escort congregants from another London synagogue away in groups “for their own safety”.
The disturbing footage came as anti-Semitic signs and hateful chants were filmed and photographed in the demonstration.
While many marched in peace, police confirmed they were looking for several individuals after footage and photos of the London march were shared on social media.Offensive signs included a placard comparing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and Gaza to Auschwitz.
Another placard showed a snake in the colours of the Israeli flag wrapped around the globe - a shocking evocation of an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about Jewish control.
Hamas-style headbands were also worn by some protesters. Many demonstrators chanted “From the River to the Sea”. The controversial phrase has been used by Palestinian nationalists and terror groups to assert territorial claims of an independent Palestinian state.
In one particularly disturbing clip, male demonstrators were seen shouting “Khayber Khayber ya yaud jadish al Mohammed sauf yaud” through a megaphone.
The anti-Semitic chant, which references a seventh-century battle in which Jewish people were massacred by a Muslim army, translates as: “Khaybar Khaybar, O Jews, Muhammad’s army will return.”
It comes as Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, continues to face heavy criticism for comments made ahead of the Armistice Day protest.
Mrs Braverman has criticised the policing of previous protests and previously described pro-Palestinian and ceasefire gatherings as “hate marches”.
Organisers of Saturday’s march had insisted it would be peaceful.
But on Saturday night, a spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “Naturally, the Jewish community is terrified.
“We are aware of Jewish families being targeted on their way out of synagogue and have received multiple reports of police having to escort congregants away in groups for their own safety.”
They added: “The placards today bore slogans and imagery that would not have looked out of place in Nazi Germany.
“Islamist extremists, the far-Left and the far-Right were out on the streets, all on one day. What a day to be a Jew in London.”
A photograph circulated on social media showed a woman carrying a painted sign which appeared to depict US President Joe Biden wearing a tie marked with the Israeli flag.
Horns were painted on Mr Biden’s head and the caption “The Puppet Master, The Mastermind Evil of All Evils”.
A video clip shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, showed another woman confronting the protester - who was wearing dark glasses and a black and white keffiyeh.
The woman confronting the pro-Palestinian marcher is heard saying: “Excuse me, that is an anti-Semitic sign, you are holding a very anti-Semitic sign…you should take that down.”
The protester then continued to walk and held her hand up in front of the camera, as the woman filming shouted: “Shame on you.”
A reply posted on the clip by the Met Police’s X account read: “Officers are actively looking for these individuals and will take proactive action when they are identified.”
The police force posted similar responses under several other images and clips - including the video of demonstrators shouting “Khayber Khayber”.
Jonathan Turner, of UK Lawyers for Israel, said: “It is clear that racist chants were made at the march and in my view criminal offences contrary to the Public Order Act were committed.
“In addition, I understand that Hamas-style headbands were worn – this was probably an offence contrary to the Terrorism Act.”
He added: “In our view policing should have been stricter at previous marches. We hope that the police have now taken on board the serious concerns that have been expressed regarding the propagation of hate on our streets, and that there is now greater determination to enforce the criminal law.”
A spokesperson for Jewish security charity Community Security Trust told The Telegraph: “Yet again a protest - attended by many people claiming to be anti-racist - contained many examples of Jew-haters with their homemade placards, obsessing about Nazism, the Holocaust; and with the old accusations of Jews or Zionist controlling politicians and the media.
“We still have Holocaust survivors living here in London.
“How much longer will they, and many others in our Jewish community, have to stand by in our own city with this anti-Semitism on display week in, week out?”
Ahead of the march, a Met Police spokesman said: “We know the cumulative impact continued protest, increasing tensions, and rising hate crimes are having across London and the fear and anxiety our Jewish communities in particular are feeling.
“They have a right to feel safe in their city, knowing they can travel across London without feeling afraid of intimidation or harassment.”
The Telegraph contacted the Palestine Solidarity Campaign for a response but did not receive one.
It is understood Met Police are investigating the incidents.

We should be alarmed: the US’s support is rapidly eroding in part thanks to Iran’s propaganda efforts
US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s trip this week to Israel, Jordan and other key players in the region vividly demonstrates the dangerous misconceptions underlying America’s Middle East policy. Blinken’s visit also shows how rapidly Joe Biden’s superficially strong support for Israel is eroding. The Israel Defense Forces are now racing against time before he wilts under domestic and international pressure, and the West’s collective enemies exploit his flawed world view. 
Why, a month after one of this century’s worst acts of barbarism, are the perpetrators and their puppet-masters moving ever closer to skating free? 
First, before and after the October 7 massacres, Iran, Hamas and others masterfully deployed their information-warfare campaigns, asymmetrically attacking Israel’s very legitimacy. Jerusalem was initially unprepared, slow in responding, and still faces inhibitions – such as a need to tell the truth – that Hamas and its allies don’t share. The anti-Israel campaign’s target is not “the Arab street”, but Western decision-makers. Indeed, across the Middle East, most cities are quiet, almost business-as-usual.
But in America and Britain, pro-Palestinian demonstrators jam the streets, denouncing alleged Israeli war crimes, and explaining away, or even justifying, Hamas’s invasion. The aim is to exploit Western weakness and lack of resolution. It seems to be working. In the UK, Labour is badly split, and in Washington, Biden faces intense pressure from the “progressive” Left. Keir Starmer sees his longed-for premiership dissolving before his eyes, and Biden worries his party’s extremists could cost him victory next November. They may both be correct.
Secondly, neither Washington nor London have articulated the larger strategic context of the Hamas attack, namely the fanatical religious and hegemonic aspirations of Tehran’s mullahs. Not doing so inevitably shields Iran and its proxies and impairs Israel’s inherent right to self-defence. Failing to see the real effective mastermind precludes addressing the full enormity of the risks Israel and its allies face – not just terrorist attacks, but straight up the escalation ladder to Iran’s nuclear weapons. Israelis get this, which is why former Mossad director Yossi Cohen urges hunting down every Iranian involved in the October 7 attacks. 
Hamas did not wake up one fine day and decide by itself to attack Israel. Along with Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Iraqi Shia militia, and many others, Hamas is a beneficiary of Iranian weapons, training, and finance. Its sneak attack has to be seen as part of Tehran’s larger strategy. Taken by surprise, Jerusalem is still struggling to grasp comprehensively Iran’s plan. Tehran’s surrogates are concealing their hand, but Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s recent speech shows their menace and resolve to break the will of Israel and its supporters by threatening wider regional war.
The Iran-Russia axis is also becoming clearer, with ominous reports that the Wagner Group will provide air defences to Hezbollah. Moscow has also criticised Israeli air strikes in Syria for violating international law, reversing long-standing acceptance of such operations. Russia and China, meanwhile, are supporting Hamas with propaganda and disinformation – a significant political signal.
Thirdly, through strategic failures of imagination and inadequate explanations of the full threats Israel faces from Iran, Britain and America risk losing the overall diplomatic battle. Blinken’s trip was to advocate for a “pause” in hostilities to allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Others are calling for a full “ceasefire”. There is no meaningful distinction between these verbal formulations. A former US Senate staffer revealed the game by writing that halting the hostilities “that begins as a temporary measure, but which could be extended, is vitally necessary”.
Moreover, while the fate of the hostages Hamas kidnapped is important, and rightly a priority for Israel and others, it is not this conflict’s true centrepiece. Governments have moral obligations to protect their citizens, and Hamas’s taking of hostages will inscribe the full picture of the group’s inhumanity into history. 
Nonetheless, a government’s moral obligations extend to the whole nation, which Israel sees today as existentially threatened. Benjamin Netanyahu correctly emphasises that it is precisely military pressure that will produce more hostage releases, not gestures of goodwill, which Iran and its terrorist surrogates disdain. But if they persuade guileless Westerners that the stakes are only humanitarian issues in Gaza, they are more likely to prevail in arguing that Israel bears responsibility for the war continuing.
Netanyahu rejected Blinken’s démarche because Israel is literally in hand-to-hand combat against Hamas, but this is only the start of the propaganda campaign. When Biden calls for Israel to “pause” and sends Blinken to plead his case in Jerusalem, we should be alarmed. Israel has the resolve to continue, but its fate may lie in Washington and London. That is not good news."

Weekly central London rallies temporarily halted in favour of national day of action after huge Armistice Day march
Pro-Palestinian activists will not march in London this Saturday but are instead planning a national day of action with up to 150 events taking place in towns and cities across the country.
Organisers said that the decision to call a temporary halt to the huge central London rallies had been taken for “logistical and strategic” reasons as the strain of coordinating the marches was “taking its toll”.
More than 700,000 people were claimed to have attended the march on Armistice Day, which was the fifth consecutive Saturday that people had gathered in London to call for an Israeli ceasefire in Gaza.
But this weekend the focus will switch to smaller regional events, with rallies, speeches and vigils taking place in dozens of towns and cities.
While the move will be welcomed by the Metropolitan Police – which has been struggling to manage what were branded “hate marches” by Suella Braverman, the home secretary at the time – the tactic is likely to create a headache for many local forces.
As well as having to tackle any incidents of hate crime and anti-Semitism that take place, forces may also have to be on guard to police any counter-demonstrations from far-Right groups.On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, met Sir Mark Rowley, the Met Commissioner, to discuss the “ongoing challenge” of policing the pro-Palestinian marches.
During a meeting at No 10, Mr Sunak stressed the “vital importance” of pursuing both Hamas supporters and “those responsible for violent scenes” near the war memorial on Armistice Day.
The Government is thought to be considering giving the police more powers to ban marches following concern that the current bar is too high.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The public rightly expect that the full force of the law is used to bear down on some of the shocking scenes of criminality we saw over the weekend, whether it was EDL protesters or those seemingly supporting Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation.”
He added: “It’s important that police have the powers they need to carry out their role and we will continue to keep that under review.”
The large-scale marches are also expected to resume in central London in coming weeks, with organisers vowing to continue their campaign until there is a ceasefire.Among the towns and cities where rallies are planned for this weekend are Bristol, Guildford, Lancaster, Liverpool, and Newcastle.
A spokesman for the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which is one of six groups organising the events, said that while it was the intention to return to large-scale marches, they had decided to take a temporary break.
They said: “From a logistical point of view, doing the national London marches is putting a huge strain on resources and supporters.
“But it is also strategic and will allow us to involve and empower more people throughout the country, not just those who can come to London.
“We want to take the message far and wide, particularly in terms of MP constituencies which adds to the political pressure for a ceasefire.”
While there is no planned march in central London this Saturday, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather in Parliament Square on Wednesday afternoon to lobby MPs ahead of a Commons vote on whether to call for a ceasefire."

The support offered by governments in the Middle East does not extend to taking in any refugees
President Biden claimed credit this week for talking to Egyptian President Sisi “to convince him to open the door” – a door that has remained resolutely shut since the Israel-Hamas conflict began nearly four weeks ago. Egypt’s miserly approach to admitting refugees from Gaza is disappointing but not surprising. The Arab world’s response to the Palestinian drama has down the decades been long on rhetoric but short on meaningful and constructive action, such as offering to take in Palestinian refugees in significant numbers. 
For many Arab countries, the Palestinian question has frequently threatened to become a domestic problem, which they are disinclined to import. And there is a disconnect between public opinion in many countries in the Middle East, seen in the demonstrations in support of the Palestinians, and the key Arab governments. 
Jordan had a civil war, also known as Black September, in 1970 after Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War led to 300,000 Palestinian refugees fleeing there. As the Palestinian militants, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), established themselves in Jordan, they came increasingly into conflict with King Hussein’s Hashemite monarchy, who they sought to overthrow. After a bitter internecine conflict, the PLO finally surrendered in July 1971 and was allowed to relocate to Lebanon. 
This didn’t end well, either. Lebanon had been home to tens of thousands of refugees since the creation of the state of Israel. The PLO’s arrival vastly increased the numbers, destabilising the already delicate institutional balance between the various confessional groups there. 
The PLO, not surprisingly, became involved in the long-running Lebanese civil war until the organisation was in turn expelled by an Israeli invasion in 1982 and it relocated to Tunis. In 1994, the Palestinian leadership returned to Gaza and the West Bank before splitting in 2006, with Hamas ruling in Gaza and the UN-recognised Palestinian Authority governing the West Bank. 
Egypt under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is no friend of Hamas. The group is an off-shoot of the Islamist organisation the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader, Mohamed Morsi, was briefly Egyptian president in 2012 until he was overthrown by Sisi the following year. (The Brotherhood has now been declared an illegal terrorist organisation not only in Egypt but also in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.) 
While Sisi talks the talk about not wanting to indulge wishes to remove Palestinians to Sinai, he has in truth more than enough to worry about domestically as it is. The Egyptian economy is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the consequent social unrest poses enough security concerns for the Egyptian leader without an influx of Palestinian refugees. 
Saudi Arabia has the space and the money to accommodate many thousands of refugees if it wished, but Mohammed Bin Salman has his own development plan, Saudi Vision 2030, to diversify economically, socially and culturally. A massive refugee influx doesn’t feature. 
One country that has stepped up to the plate is the UAE, which was also among the first countries in the region to open diplomatic ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. It has just announced that it will treat 1,000 children from Gaza. While a welcome step, it is a drop in the ocean. 
As for the Arab League, it has received a request from Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority for an emergency summit to be held on November 11. Yet few will be holding their breath in the hope of a major humanitarian gesture, such as taking in, even temporarily, a large number of Palestinian refugees, not just 1,000 children from Gaza. 
There will certainly be strident declarations of support for Gaza. But the reality is that the rhetoric would appear to conceal a sense of guilt. Arab countries’ solidarity with the Palestinians has never been channelled into finding any kind of constructive solution to what has been an intractable and, to their governments if not their people, a profoundly unwelcome problem. As for the two-state solution agreed by Israel and the PLO in 1993 – rehashing a UN-approved partition plan of 1947 rejected by the Arab states – its time will come again. But, sadly, not before a good deal more blood has been shed. "

Tens of thousands of protesters have begun to gather in central London for a pro-Palestinian rally.
Almost a month after the conflict began - sparked by the barbaric attack on southern Israel by Hamas militants - a huge crowd is expected in Trafalgar Square to demand an end to the bombardment of Gaza.
It is the latest in a series of large-scale demonstrations since the outbreak of war. Saturday’s rally is due to begin at around 2.30pm and comes amid demands by senior ministers, including prime minister Rishi Sunak, for a crackdown on any support shown for hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.
Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters have already assembled outside the BBC’s Broadcasting House where they have waved placards and shouted anti-Israel chants.
Some demonstrators wore face masks and keffiyeh head scarves, while others held picket signs with messages, written in crimson red paint, calling for Israel boycotts and accusing the Israeli and British governments of having “blood” on their hand
The Metropolitan Police has said there will be a “sharper focus” on using social media and face recognition to detect criminal behaviour at protests this weekend. Police spotters will be out in force, filming the crowds for any activity that might be in breach of public order and terror laws.

On Middle Eastern Affairs, Ireland has long been the EU’s weakest link
The most charitable interpretation you can put on the demand by Irish foreign minister Micheál Martin for a ceasefire in Gaza is that he sees Ireland as a kind of global Mother Theresa, with the power and influence to acts as a neutral intermediary and bring peace between the world’s sworn enemies. 
I hate to break it to him, but Ireland’s attempt to drag the EU into demanding a ceasefire is not going to bring peace. All it is going to achieve is to make Ireland look ridiculous.
Soon after Martin made his latest plea, Hamas official Ghazi Hamad made his own intervention. Terror attacks like that of 7th October – i.e. the shameless murders of civilians – will continue until Israel has been annihilated, he said. 
Of course, there are many civilians who have lost their lives in Gaza as a result of Israel’s air strikes and ground invasion, and that is a tragedy. Israel must do everything it can to minimise civilian casualties – not easy given that Hamas has embedded itself in residential areas. 
But you can’t treat Israel and Hamas as if they were military powers whose rivalry has got a little out of hand and which might be brought to their senses as a result of an appeal from western statesmen. One is a democratic country, the other a terrorist group led by fanatics who are not going to engage in reasoned negotiation. Were Israel to put down its weapons at this stage, all it would achieve is to allow Hamas to regroup – and stage another surprise atrocity, as they have pledged.
You would think that Ireland’s foreign minister, of all people, would know that if you want to negotiate with a terrorist group it is first going to have to recognise that its enemies are not going to agree to be annihilated. The Good Friday Agreement only happened after the IRA accepted that Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom and that this will only change as part of a democratic process. It was pretty unpalatable to see the likes of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness given the red carpet treatment, but by 1998 they had adopted a very, very different position compared with that of Hamas now.
It isn’t just Micheal Martin, though. Long before Hamas, Irish governments were cosying up to Yasser Arafat and the PLO. To mark the 50th anniversary of Six Days’ War the Palestinian flag was flown from Dublin City Hall. On Middle Eastern Affairs, Ireland has long been the EU’s weakest link, trying to persuade it to adopt an unashamedly pro-Palestinian position. Immediately after last month’s terror attacks Ireland was one of three countries – along with Denmark and Luxembourg – reported to have attempted to water down the EU’s condemnation. The Irish foreign ministry denied it had objected to the EU calling Hamas a terrorist group, but stopped tellingly short of using that terminology itself – saying only that all member states were signed up to the EU’s statement.
Sorry, Ireland, but if you want to pose as the world’s lofty-thinking peacemaker, Norway has grabbed that slot for itself. The current Norwegian government, too, seemed to have a bit of a problem with calling Hamas a terror group, and had to be dragged into it by the opposition. 
But at least Norway has a longer and more convincing history as a global peace-broker."

One adviser to Mayor of London accused Israel of ‘settler colonialism’ while another said the country was committing ‘genocide’
An adviser to Sadiq Khan on policing accused Israel of “settler colonialism”, while another adviser accused the country of genocide, The Telegraph can reveal.
The Mayor of London has been accused of a “shocking” lack of judgement as it emerged one of his advisers responsible for scrutinising reform of the Metropolitan Police said he could “never respect Israel as a settlement or a country”.
A second adviser helping to shape Mr Khan’s equality, diversity and inclusion strategy repeatedly accused Israel of genocide, while a third shared a post claiming that Palestinians have faced a “brutal settler colonial occupation” for 75 years and are now immersed in an “anti-colonial and anti-apartheid” struggle.
The Campaign Against Antisemitism urged Mr Khan to sack all three advisers and “publicly reject” their views in light of the “startling” revelations.
“The views in these posts would be of concern coming from any member of the public, but coming from people in charge of equality, diversity and inclusion in London, and even of overseeing policing in our capital, they are totally out of order,” it said.
Mr Khan’s team said he did “not agree” with the advisers’ views, stressing the individuals concerned were “very much independent from the Mayor”.
The first adviser, Sayce Holmes-Lewis, is a member of the London Policing Board tasked with helping the Mayor scrutinise “urgent reform” of the Met after a damning report found the force was institutionally racist, sexist and homophobic.
He also trains Scotland Yard on engaging with the black community, according to his website.
Last year, before the policing board was established, Mr Holmes-Lewis said he could “never respect Israel as a settlement or a country”.
‘Israel should face boycotts for war crimes’
Sharing a clip appearing to show Israeli forces attacking a Palestinian journalist’s funeral procession, he wrote: “Absolutely sickening and disgusting. I can never respect Israel as a settlement or a country. The occupation of Palestine is unlawful & inhumane.
“We are witnessing a genocide of innocent people. We are all being oppressed by the same system of colonialism #PalestinianLivesMatter”.
In a separate tweet, also posted last year, he suggested Israel should face boycotts like Russia for its “war crimes”.
“I’m just wondering when all these Western administrations, organisations & sporting governing bodies are going to boycott Israel for their war crimes & the continual oppression of Palestinian people. Russia has been boycotted globally in record time. Don’t forget Israel either,” he said.
Mr Holmes-Lewis, an entrepreneur, mentor and activist, previously came under fire for reportedly calling Covid “the greatest hustle of all time” and warning against “climate lockdowns”.
The controversial comments, which surfaced a month after his appointment to the board was announced in September, were branded “hugely irresponsible” by the deputy leader of the City Hall Conservatives.
Challenged on the vetting process earlier this month, Mr Khan said he had been “reassured” that all the members of the policing board had undergone the “proper checks”.
The other two activists, Asma Shah and Peter Wieltschnig, are both members of the Mayor’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Advisory Group.According to its dedicated webpage, the panel “shapes, influences and guides the delivery of the Mayor’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy”.
Ms Shah, a charity leader, has accused Israel of genocide, apartheid and “settler colonialism”.
On Oct 26, shortly after Israeli tanks and troops launched a “targeted raid” on Gaza, she tweeted: “Watching from the sidelines and going mad as genocide is committed in 2023 to the applause of western leaders, and humanitarians are arrested for protesting for the lives of #Palestine #settlercolonialism #Apartheid_Israel #CeaseFireInGaza”.
The term “settler colonialism” is sometimes used by critics of the Israeli state to describe the political and demographic shifts in the area since the late 19th century.
The Anti-Defamation League, an international Jewish civil rights group, has warned this is an “inaccurate” characterisation and “often serves as part of the effort to chip away at or negate Israel’s legitimacy”.
Ms Shah has also criticised Sir Keir Starmer for refusing to call for a ceasefire, accusing him of “egging on genocide”.
Asked to comment, she told The Telegraph: “My concerns are for a ceasefire in order for the killing of children and other innocents in Gaza to stop. I don’t express this hope as a member of the EDI which is a London-focused group, I do so as a human who is really troubled to keep seeing the numbers of innocents being killed rising and the world is letting it happen.
“I am in solidarity with Jews all over the world and in London too who are peacefully protesting and calling for a ceasefire.”
Mr Wieltschnig has not attacked Israel in his own words, but he recently shared a statement from the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain claiming that “over the past 75 years Palestinians have faced a brutal settler colonial occupation”.
It added: “We reject the proposition that anti-Zionism and criticisms of Israel equate to anti-semitism. The struggle for the liberation of Palestine is an anti-colonial and anti-apartheid struggle and as such is supported by millions of workers of all faiths and backgrounds, including Muslim and Jewish communities, across the world.”
‘Mayor must remove individuals from their positions’
A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said: “These revelations are startling. The Mayor’s EDI Advisory Group does not seem to be particularly inclusive when there are members who do not recognise the legitimacy of a Jewish state, especially the assertion that Israel, since its inception 75 years ago, has represented a ‘brutal settler colonial occupation’.
“Moreover, for someone on the London Policing Board to appear to hold similar views is even more disturbing, particularly at a time of such scrutiny in relation to the Met’s controversial handling of the recent protests. If Mr Holmes-Lewis ‘can never respect Israel as a settlement or a country,’ how can he and those he oversees respect the Jewish community that identifies so closely with the Jewish state?”
The statement added: “The Mayor must publicly reject these views and remove these individuals from their positions.”
A Conservative Party source said: “It is shocking that Sadiq Khan seems to believe it is acceptable for his advisers to hold these views and it shows once again that he is completely out of touch with Londoners’ values.”
A spokesman for Mr Khan said: “The Mayor does not agree with these views and comments. These board members are very much independent from the Mayor and will therefore have a variety of opinions that will not be in line with the Mayor’s.”
Mr Holmes-Lewis, Mr Wieltschnig and the Labour Party have all been approached for comment"

Former attorney general has written to Tim Davie, the corporation’s director-general, demanding he release the findings of a 2004 inquiry
The BBC must publish an internal report on anti-Israel bias that has been “suppressed” for almost two decades, a former attorney general has said.
Sir Michael Ellis, one of Britain’s most prominent Jewish politicians, made the demand in a letter to Tim Davie, the corporation’s director-general.
He warned that the broadcaster had “suffered worldwide reputational damage” over criticism of its reporting and its refusal to call Hamas terrorists.
BBC bosses ordered the internal inquiry, called the Balen Report, back in 2004 following repeated complaints of bias by the Israeli government.
It was carried out by Malcolm Balen, a senior journalist, but has since been suppressed with the corporation going to court to keep its findings secret. 
Calls for the investigation to be released have grown louder following mounting criticism of the BBC’s coverage of events in Israel and Gaza.
The broadcaster was heavily criticised after it speculated that Tel Aviv was to blame for the bombing of a hospital, which it is now widely accepted was carried out by jihadi militants.
It has also repeatedly refused to call Hamas terrorists, instead describing them as “militants”, which has sparked condemnation from Rishi Sunak.
‘Lack of transparency’
In his letter, seen by The Telegraph, Sir Michael warned that complaints of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s reporting were now “greater than ever”.
The former cabinet minister urged Mr Davie to commit to “the same transparency it seeks in others” and set out a timetable for publishing the inquiry.
“The BBC’s erroneous and highly damaging misreporting of the hospital explosion in Gaza was one of the most shocking errors in news reporting for generations and has caused real harm, as well as long lasting reputational damage,” he wrote.
“Furthermore, the BBC’s refusal to describe Hamas as a terrorist organisation, despite the UK Government proscribing them as such, has caused further distress and concern.
“The Balen Report has been suppressed by the BBC since it was written. Nearly 20 years on, the public are more concerned than ever at BBC partiality on this sensitive subject.”
‘Fighting to keep it a secret’
Mr Davie said that he would “consider” releasing the dossier after being grilled about it during a recent appearance before the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs.
Sir Michael said the fact that the broadcaster had racked up £350,000 in legal fees fighting to keep it secret created a “suspicion that the report is unfavourable to the BBC”.
He added: “The BBC has already suffered worldwide reputational damage with its recent reporting of the Middle East crisis. It is in the public interest that they publish this report now.”
Several backbench Tory MPs have now called on the corporation to release the findings.
The BBC has said the report was commissioned “for the purposes of journalism” and so falls outside the scope of freedom of information laws.
Mr Davie is understood to have argued the broadcaster needs to be able to commission internal advice in the knowledge it will remain private.
He pointed out memos to ministers are treated similarly, on the basis that civil servants may not feel free to provide honest opinions if they feared publication."

Campaigners say it has been designated as an unlawful organisation in Israel since 2010 and the UK government ‘should pay more attention’
A Palestinian campaign group operating legally in London was designated an unlawful organisation by the Israeli government over disputed claims of links with the Hamas terror group.
The Palestinian Return Centre (PRC), which has held meetings in the Houses of Parliament and advises the United Nations over the plight of Palestinian refugees, was accused by the Israeli security services of backing the activity of Hamas in Europe, while “de-legitimizing Israel’s status as a nation”.
Campaigners have now called for the British government to review the status of the PRC and ban the group.
Caroline Turner, director of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) told the Telegraph: “Currently the UK government totally disregards Israel’s designation of UK organisations. In our view the Palestinian Return Centre should be proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.
“It has been designated as an unlawful organisation in Israel since December 2010. The UK government ought to pay more attention.”
Forcefully disputed 
The claims are forcefully disputed by the PRC, who deny supporting Hamas activities.
The PRC was awarded special consultative status by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in 2015 on Palestinian related matters, and that year held a public seminar at the Houses of Parliament and another, chaired by Baroness Jenny Tonge, in the House of Lords.
Five years earlier, Ehud Bara, the then Israeli defence minister, had signed a decree declaring the PRC an illegal association, accusing it of promoting Hamas’s agenda in Europe and directly interacting with its leadership in Gaza and the Gulf states.
In an assessment prepared for its government, Shin Bet, the Israel security services, claimed: “The Palestinian Return Centre’s activities are part of Hamas’s activities in the Palestinian communities in Europe in general and Britain in particular.
“They belong to the overall undertaking conducted by Hamas around the world to support its activities in the internal Palestinian arena.”
In a separate 2011 report, Israel’s Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Centre, which has ties to the Israel Defense Forces, said that conferences organised by the PRC across a number of European countries included Hamas representatives in Europe and the Gaza Strip.
The report claims that in its statements in Arabic the PRC often expressed solidarity with the Palestinian intifada and the Hamas leadership.
In 2019, Paypal said it was no longer working as a payment method for the PRC’s online store, with potential customers still unable to use the online payments system. The move by Paypal followed submissions by UKLFI.
In one of its most recent reports on the bombardment of Gaza, which followed the Oct 7 attacks on Israel, the PRC described Hamas as a “resistance group”.
The PRC, which has called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, claimed in a press release, published the day of the Hamas attack which killed more that 1,400 people, that: “Israel alone is responsible for this escalation in the occupied Palestinian territory due to its continuous incursions into Al-Aqsa Mosque and violations of the rights of the Palestinian people to freedom of worship.”
It added: “PRC reaffirms its unswerving stance vis-à-vis the justice of the Palestinian struggle and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
The PRC, which is registered with Companies House as a private company operating out of offices on the North Circular Road in north-west London, says it is a not-for-profit independent group whose mission is to highlight the conditions in which Palestinian refugees live and argue for their “right to return” to Israel.
‘Strongly renounces all acts of terror’
It says that claims it is affiliated with Hamas are unfounded, adding that the Israeli allegations have no credence.
Lawyers for the PRC told the Telegraph that “PRC strongly renounces all acts of terror, whether by Hamas or anywhere else, including the attacks of October 7”.
Their lawyers added: “Our client’s long-standing position is that its designation by the Israeli government (but not by the UK or any other government) as an illegal organisation is, and always has been, unjustified and purely politically motivated.
“Our client has not shied away from criticising the Israeli regime, but that is plainly not a basis for alleging that it promotes or encourages terrorism.”
The PRC says that previously, like all NGOs and charities who work with individuals in Gaza, it needed to engage with the political wing of Hamas as the governing authority in order to function in the area.
But it says that since 2018 it has “pivoted its main focus to providing consultative contributions to the UN on matters of Palestine” and has not had any engagement with Hamas at all.
Under the Terrorism Act 2000, the Home Secretary can prescribe an organisation if they reasonably believe it is concerned in terrorism and it is proportionate to do so.
A government spokesman said: “Whilst the Government keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, we do not comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered for proscription.”"

The latest Israel-Hamas controversy involving it's Asian Network presenter will constitute a genuine crisis for the broadcaster
The scale of the BBC’s failings on the Israel-Hamas war now constitutes a genuine crisis for our national broadcaster. To lose the widespread support of one of Britain’s minority communities in such a profound way is a significant stain on the BBC’s reputation and its role as our national broadcaster.
The latest revelations, that presenters on the BBC’s Asian Network have been posting incendiary, deeply offensive and anti-Israel material online since Oct 7 is both shocking in its own right and symptomatic of the wider failures that are now engulfing the BBC.
Since the Hamas terrorist attacks, BBC presenters whose salaries are paid with licence fees and who have large online followings have accused Israel of genocide, ethnic cleansing and war crimes – and have encouraged people to attend marches at which anti-Semitism has been on open display.
Of the many toxic posts that have come to light, one sticks in my mind as particularly disturbing. On Oct 7, Noreen Khan tweeted a disputed graphic showing the relative territories governed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the past decades.
Ms Khan chose to post this on the day of the pogrom in Israel.
As families were being burnt alive in their homes, women raped and children kidnapped, Khan felt that this was not a moment for sympathy for Jewish suffering, but an opportunity for a BBC employee to use her platform to make an anti-Israel statement. In doing so she came perilously close to attempting to justify horrific acts of terrorism still taking place at that very time.
To make matters worse, the issue is not simply one of individual BBC employees expressing bias and hate towards Israel, but rather of widespread senior management failure.
Lost control
Ms Khan’s tweet remained on her social media page for anyone to come across. This is despite BBC management, including Lorna Clarke, the BBC’s director of music, being warned on more than one occasion by a concerned listener about the content being posted by BBC Asian Network presenters. Ms Khan and her fellow presenters clearly felt no pressure to delete their social media posts and BBC managers did not do anything effective to stop them.
This means that senior management is either complicit in anti-Israel bias at the BBC or has lost control of their own staff and the content they produce. Whichever is the case it leaves the BBC’s reputation for impartiality in tatters.
The BBC’s Asian Network is far from alone in discrediting the corporation since Oct 7. To take two recent examples, Caroline Hawley, the BBC’s diplomatic correspondent, has repeatedly tweeted unbalanced, seemingly unverified claims from Gaza, while Jeremy Bowen, the international editor of BBC News, has admitted his coverage of the explosion at Al-Ahli hospital was “wrong” but that he “doesn’t regret one thing”. You could not find a better example of institutional arrogance than Mr Bowen’s review of his own reporting.
Meanwhile, the BBC’s Arabic service has produced different versions of its output, the Arab language version of a story omitting significant details about the terrorist organisation Hamas. It makes one wonder how much of BBC Arabic’s reporting in recent weeks is similarly biased and anti-Israel. A translation study of the bureau’s Arabic-language output since Oct 7 would be instructive.
Given these almost daily examples of anti-Israel bias, it must be extremely tough at the moment for Jewish people working at the BBC. Their distress would doubtless have been intensified by the BBC’s highest-paid presenter, Gary Lineker, choosing to retweet material accusing Israel of genocide. In Mr Lineker’s case, it is notable that his concern for humanity did not extend to speaking out on Oct 7 when Jews were being barbarically massacred on a scale not seen since the Holocaust.
Duty of care
Yet again, what is even more striking is the failure of BBC management to do anything about it. It appears that no action is being taken against Mr Lineker. In light of this – and the toxic content being pumped out by BBC Asian Network presenters – it is clear that the latest social media guidelines issued by the director-general of the BBC just weeks ago are not fit for purpose.
The BBC must ask itself whether it is failing in its duty of care towards its Jewish employees. Is it possible for them to feel like they are working in a safe and neutral environment when BBC management fails them so badly? An investigation into anti-Semitism within the BBC is now necessary, alongside a further review of its social media guidelines and the need for an independent assessment of the corporation’s Israel output.
This all amounts to a profound system failure at our national broadcaster that impacts both the BBC’s credibility and the safety and welfare of Britain’s Jewish community. The BBC is contributing to an atmosphere in the UK in which many Jewish people do not feel safe.
The stain on the BBC’s reputation will be hard to repair. Sadly, it appears that the BBC’s management are either unwilling or unable to really get to grips with the scale of the problem that they face."

Eric Salama says he thought charity's approach was 'profoundly wrong' after it signed petition that criticised Israeli bombing
Comic Relief has been plunged into crisis after its chairman resigned over the charity’s stance on Gaza, it can be revealed.
Eric Salama quit his position after he said Comic Relief’s management took “an approach to an issue which I thought was profoundly wrong and which I could not live with”.
The issue is understood to have been the charity’s decision to join dozens of other organisations in calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.
Comic Relief admitted the fallout came over “a stance being taken on a public issue without any prior consultation with the board or Eric as chair”.
The move has raised questions about the governance of one of Britain’s highest-profile charities. It was set up in 1985 by Richard Curtis, the director and screenwriter, and Sir Lenny Henry in response to the famine in Ethiopia.
There are fears that corporate donors might shy away from being linked to any organisation perceived to be taking sides in the conflict.
The row may also threaten Comic Relief’s partnership with the BBC, which has itself been criticised for alleged bias in its reporting of the Gaza-Israel conflict. Calls for a ceasefire have also split the Labour Party.
Comic Relief has previously found itself drawn into controversy over questions of a “white saviour complex” in its work in African countries, though its defenders say it always works in partnership with local organisations and people.
Its annual televised Red Nose Day Appeal, featuring a panoply of pop stars, celebrities, sportsmen, musicians and ordinary viewers, has raised more than £1.4 billion since it was first held in 1988.
Mr Salama, who was appointed as chairman in June 2020, wrote on Twitter: “I admired Richard Curtis and Lenny Henry from afar before I joined and have even more respect and admiration and love for two wonderful human beings now that I’ve got to know them.
“All of which made last week particularly sad for me, stepping down early from my role and letting some people down in the process.”
He added: “But there are times in life when principles really matter more than any job. And last week was one of those times when management took an approach to an issue which I thought was profoundly wrong and which I could not live with.”
Among the demands of the “ceasefire now” petition signed by Comic Relief were calls for the freeing of all civilian hostages, especially children and the elderly.
It also calls for humanitarian convoys to be allowed to reach UN facilities, schools, hospitals, and health facilities in northern Gaza and for Israel to rescind its orders to civilians to leave northern Gaza.
The petition states: “We have witnessed unfathomable death and destruction in the Gaza Strip and Israel.”
It goes on to condemn the Israeli army for reportedly bombing civilians “as they attempted to flee or once they arrived in southern Gaza,” adding: “Neighbourhoods have been destroyed and turned into complete rubble. Palestinians in search of safety have nowhere to go.”
Comic Relief said in a statement on its website: “Eric decided to step down as chair of Comic Relief, and has brought forward the date of his departure from the previously announced retirement date of March 2024. Eric’s decision relates to a stance being taken on a public issue without any prior consultation with the board or Eric as chair.”
Comic Relief declined to say precisely what had led to Mr Salama’s resignation when asked by The Telegraph about the issue of Gaza.
A spokesman for the charity told the Telegraph: “Although we do not comment on internal matters relating to our staff or members of the board, we have announced that Eric has brought forward the date he is leaving.”
The charity added: “Comic Relief was formed in response to a humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, and we have joined over 700 charities, including many of the most prominent in the UK, in signing a petition about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel that is focused on the need to protect civilians and children on all sides of the conflict.”
Other charities that have signed the petition include Palestinian groups, as well as the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, Oxfam, the Baptist Union of Wales, and human rights and environmental campaigners.
High-profile role in City
Mr Salama was appointed chairman of Comic Relief following a glittering career in the City, where he rose to become the chairman of Verian Group, formerly Kantar, the consumer insight division of WPP. He has also been chief executive of Kantar and a non-executive director of the British Museum.
In a statement posted online, Comic Relief said Mr Salama’s position would be taken over by Tom Shropshire, one of its trustees.
Following his appointment as interim chairman, Mr Shropshire said: “On behalf of the board and team at Comic Relief, I would like to thank Eric for all he has done for the charity, including steering Comic Relief through the Covid-19 pandemic and helping to shape our current strategy. 
“We wish Eric well in the future and look forward to having his continued support in the important work being done by Comic Relief and its partners.”
Mr Salama was approached for comment.
Accusations of bias
Comic Relief’s broadcast partner the BBC, is already facing accusations of bias in the Gaza-Israel conflict and Mr Salama’s sudden resignation comes after corporation staff accused it of double standards after they were told not to attend a march against anti-Semitism this weekend.
Staff working in current affairs and factual journalism who have sought permission to go to the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism march in London have been referred to impartiality rules.
According to the rules, editorial staff “should not participate in public demonstrations or gatherings about controversial issues”.
Jewish employees have argued that protesting against racism should not be regarded as a controversial or partisan issue, and that the BBC should not stand in their way.
A BBC spokesman said: “The BBC is clear that anti-Semitism is abhorrent. We have established guidance around marches, which explains that different considerations apply depending on what you do for the BBC.
“Corporately, we have not issued any staff communication on any specific march this weekend, but this does not mean discussions which consider the guidance have not taken place between colleagues.”"

The destruction of Israel and the emboldening of Hamas would make life unlivable for gay Palestinians
When I first heard the phrase “Queers for Palestine”, I assumed it was a joke, a meme dreamt up by some Right-wing wag on Reddit. There is surely no way actual gay people would cheer on a state infamous for its loathing of homosexuals.
For all their zaniness, surely not even purple-haired, post-gender activists would take to the streets, Pride flag in hand, to champion a country that would jail them, if they’re lucky, and bump them off if they’re not. 
But it’s not a joke. These people are real. This is where wokeness has taken us – to a situation where the young of the West are throwing their lot in with a regime that would throw them from a top-floor given half a chance.
“Queers for Palestine” has become the source of much online mirth in recent weeks, following Hamas’s October 7 pogrom. And deservedly so. People have compared it to “Chickens for KFC”. I saw one comment on Instagram noting that if these people actually went to Palestine, especially Hamas-ruled Gaza, their pronouns would be “was / were”.
I feel tempted to say “it’s funny because it’s true”, but none of this is funny. Palestine has an atrocious record on LGBT rights. In 2021, the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles carried out a survey of 175 nations and their acceptance of gay and gender-non-conforming people.
Palestine was at number 130. Behind Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The “Queers for Palestine” would literally be better off in the notoriously homophobic petro-Kingdom of Saudi Arabia than in their favourite victim nation.
Gay people face staggering levels of persecution in both Gaza and the West Bank. Jail and sometimes even death awaits those who commit the “sin” of carnal knowledge with a member of the same sex.
In 2016, Hamas executed one of their own top dogs, Mahmoud Ishtiwi, reportedly for sleeping with a man. Last year, 25-year-old Ahmad Abu Marhia, a gay man, was beheaded by thuggish homophobes in Hebron in the West Bank. Footage of this gruesome hate crime was uploaded to social media.
At the time of his death, Mr Abu Marhia was seeking asylum in… you guessed it, Israel. That might be because, where Palestine was at number 130 on UCLA’s list of gay-friendly states, Israel was at number 44.
Many gay Palestinians flee to Israel, usually to the famously flamboyant cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa. A few years ago, the Israeli gay-rights group Aguda estimated that around 2,000 LGBT people from Palestine live in Tel Aviv at any one time. The Jewish State gives them a haven from homophobia. It allows them to be their true selves. If they were to try that in Palestine, ridicule and violence would be their lot.
It’s fine to make fun of “Queers for Palestine”. But let us take a moment to reflect on how rank it is that these privileged Westerners dream of erasing the one nation to which LGBT Palestinians can flee for safety and liberty.
It is grotesque that in New York, London and Berlin, young gay people who enjoy every right known to man are singing the praises of a nation that would happily persecute them, and damning a nation in which they could live freely and happily. “Queers for Palestine” is condemning “Queers in Palestine” to further torment and tyranny.
For if these virtue-signallers were to get their way, and the only thing that existed between “the river and the sea” was Palestine, Palestinian homosexuals would suffer unimaginably. The removal of Israel and the emboldening of Hamas would make life intolerable, unlivable in fact, for gay Palestinians. With friends like this, who needs homophobic oppressors?
This is what happens when advertising one’s virtue takes precedence over thinking carefully about other people’s needs; when the narcissistic needs of spoiled Westerners are accorded more importance than the rights of faraway peoples. All that matters in the self-regarding moral universe of “Queers for Palestine” is the warm glow experienced by those who march behind that deranged banner. Actual Palestinians – gay, straight, whatever – are little more than bit-part players in the self-promoting morality plays of well-off Westerners keen to advertise their decency to the world."

John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn were pictured marching alongside a pro-Hamas activist at the Palestine protest on Armistice Day.
The former shadow chancellor and ex-Labour leader could be seen at the front of the National March for Palestine alongside Adnan Hmidan, a journalist who works for the London-based TV channel al-Hiwar.
Mr McDonnell stood directly to the left of Mr Hmidan as they carried a banner at the front of the procession, while another demonstrator stood between Mr Hmidan and Mr Corbyn.
A social media post by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, one of the organisers of the weekly demonstrations against Israel’s military response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks, read: “Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell join the front of our march for a #CeasefireNow.”
Mr Hmidan has sought to justify a number of attacks by Hamas militants on Jews on his Twitter profile, where he writes mostly in Arabic.
Following the 2014 Jerusalem synagogue attack, which saw four worshippers and a policeman killed by two Palestinian men, he wrote: “The killing (sic) of the Jewish synagogue is a natural reaction to an enemy who did not respect the sanctity of a mosque or a home, and never shied away from killing, suffocating, burning and besieging the Palestinians.”
In the wake of the October 7 attacks in which more than 1,200 Israeli Jews were murdered, he posted: “What is happening is the normal situation, and the usurping invaders are the aggressors first and foremost. If there had been no occupation, there would have been no resistance.
“However, recently, the Zionists’ provocations have increased in an unprecedented manner: from the raids on Al-Aqsa to the stripping of a number of women in Hebron to the raids in the West Bank, and the list goes on.”
Mr Hmidan had deactivated his Twitter account as of Friday afternoon but The Telegraph obtained screenshots of the remarks in question prior to its deletion.
 
Facebook account
A post on his public Facebook account which dates from March 2018 includes the caption “I love this man” below an image of Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas.
Mr Hmidan was a member of Labour as recently as 2021, when he instructed lawyers to write to the party questioning its recruitment of a former Israeli army officer in a campaign role.
He said in March 2021 he was “very concerned” about the appointment and suggested it would involve “monitoring” the social media accounts of Labour members who were British Palestinian or supported Palestine.

Mr Corbyn, who has sat as an independent MP since his suspension by Sir Keir in October 2020, also voted in favour of a ceasefire.
In an interview with TalkTV’s Piers Morgan Uncensored, he refused to describe Hamas as terrorists on at least 15 occasions. Hamas’s military wing has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the British government since 2001.
Mr McDonnell, Mr Corbyn, Mr Hmidan and the Labour Party were contacted for comment.
A source close to Mr Corbyn said: “Jeremy is not responsible for the attendance nor the words of an individual that happens to be pictured nearby. Jeremy has repeatedly condemned the horrific terror attack by Hamas on October 7, as well as the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza in response, and continues to call for an immediate ceasefire to stop any further loss of life.”"

Jonathan Hall KC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, told the Telegraph he was “very worried” about potential clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and far-right groups massing to “defend” the Cenotaph on Saturday.
“I’m looking on aghast and thinking, ‘What could happen?’ It’s obviously a real risk,” Hall said. “Terrorism is always affected by external events. The rise in the threat level and the terrible events of 2017 can only have come because of what was happening in Syria and Iraq. It’s inevitable I’m afraid that people here will be emboldened to act.” Hall, who travelled to Israel last Christmas for a family holiday and has previously visited counter-terrorism authorities there, said that his wife and children are Jewish and the current situation “cuts very deeply indeed”. 
He is examining whether terror laws need to be changed to criminalise the “glorification of terrorist acts”, including celebrations of the Hamas massacre on 7 Oct. Hall said the current rising tensions hark back to infamous protests targeting Remembrance Day in 2010 by the Islamist group Muslims Against Crusades, which was later banned as a terrorist organisation. Activists burned red poppies and shouted “British soldiers burn in hell” during the two-minute silence for Armistice Day, while facing down members of the English Defence League (EDL) in Kensington. “That was seen by them as a good recruiting tool,” Hall said. “You’ve got these old actors who are there waiting in the wings and it’s possible that we’ll get new groups developing.”
Hall said the security services’ work to dismantle influential Islamist networks, such as Anjem Choudary’s al-Muhajiroun, and later to ban neo-Nazi terrorist groups were “effective” in the 2010s. “We’re now more concerned about an atomised landscape and lone actors but there’s nothing to stop people reforming if the cause is big enough,” he warned. 
The EDL’s co-founder is now among activists calling for an “uncontrollable mass of men” to gather at the Cenotaph on Saturday and hundreds of extra police officers are being drafted into London for a huge security operation. Members of Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir rallied during previous pro-Palestinian protests to call for “jihad”, and several other demonstrators have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences relating to banners and pictures. The Metropolitan Police has not made any arrests over shouts of “jihad” and said it had “not identified any offences” during the Hizb ut-Tahrir rally, adding that the word jihad has a “number of meanings”.
Hall said that was a “mistake” and that police should have launched an investigation. “It seems to me that the use of jihad in that context by someone who’s not speaking Arabic, in the context of a Middle Eastern demonstration, after a massacre of Jews could have amounted to terrorism,” he said.
Current laws cover offences including encouraging terrorism and inviting support for banned groups, but they can be difficult to prove in relation to protests. “I think there are circumstances where people appear to be glorifying the act [on 7 October] and I’m not convinced that our law currently captures it,” Hall said. 
At the moment, he is drawing up a report to be sent to the government, which could recommend ministers update the Terrorism Act to cover the “glorification of terrorist acts”, rather than just the groups that commit them. “It would be a small tweak in the context of a summary offence,” Hall explained. “What you’re looking at here is trying to control behaviour which might have an impact, rather than people who are necessarily intending to encourage terrorism.” Such a change would not automatically criminalise phrases such as “from the river to the sea” and calling for “jihad”, which have generated demands for action from the home secretary and other Conservatives.
Hall said the UK has a “tradition of not banning particular words” and that laws are geared towards context and the conduct of people using them. “It would be against the grain for us to say ‘no’ to any particular display of an otherwise legitimate symbol like a Palestinian flag,” he added. “We look at what people are doing and the effect of what they do, rather than saying that certain words or actions are verboten.”
But he said officers must “control” behaviour at protests and intervene where there are “reasonable grounds” someone may be supporting terrorism, even if the exact offence may be uncertain. “If you don’t intervene when people are initiating a chant of ‘jihad’, you might have more people potentially taking it up,” he warned. “I think that often they tend to be misguided and caught up in the moment, but the consequence of that in terms of the impact on people who might be emboldened could be catastrophic. Sometimes there will be a price of not intervening, as well as the price of intervening.”
Terrorist groups including Isis and al-Qaeda have put out propaganda celebrating the Hamas atrocities and calling for attacks on Jews, Israeli and Western targets around the world. Meanwhile, neo-Nazi and far-right extremists have also been utilising the conflict to spread their ideology, while reports of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic hate crimes are rocketing across the UK.
Hall said hostile states were also “taking advantage of this huge destabilisation” and spreading disinformation on social media to further their own goals. “I think we’re going to have to be careful of false flags,” he warned. “That will be particularly true online, but it may also be true in the real world.”
He is also concerned about the “extraordinarily low” amount of resources put into content moderation by social media companies amid concerns that changes on X, formerly known as Twitter, is allowing more conspiracy theories, hateful content and terrorist material to spread. “All it takes is for one tech bro or multimillionaire to say, ‘Let’s tweak the algorithm in favour of more free speech’ and it has a huge effect,” he said.
Hall is also sounding the alarm about the potential impact of AI “chatbots”, after it emerged that Jaswant Singh Chail, who plotted to kill the Queen with a crossbow at Windsor Castle in 2021 had been encouraged by an online character. A judge found Chail was psychotic at the time and had “lost touch with reality”, spending much of the previous month “in communication with an AI chatbot as if she was a real person”. Jailing Chail at the Old Bailey in October, Mr Justice Hilliard said the defendant had been “encouraged” by the programme and that an expert concluded that “the supportive AI programming may have served to bolster and reinforce [Chail’s] intentions”.
Hall showed The Telegraph an online store where the app Chail used is on offer alongside others focusing on companionship, which were all advertised using computer-generated images of sexualised women. “You’ve got a combination of sex and reinforcement,” he said. “The big risk from AI in the immediate short term is its persuasiveness. We’ve already got this cadre of people who are lonely, many of them neurodiverse, who will probably depend more upon technology for companionship and reinforcement than other people. And now we have what feels like a sort of seductive, God-like authoritative partner who will sometimes tell us what we want to hear and perhaps worse.”
Hall is also concerned about the high number of children being convicted of terror offences relating to their use of the internet. One in six people arrested on suspicion of terror offences in Britain was under 18 in the year to June, with eight charged and three convicted in the same period. Most of the terror offences committed by children involve viewing or sharing terrorist propaganda and the majority of cases have been extreme right-wing.
Hall, who has three children, aged from teens to early 20s, is arguing for the creation of a new “child diversion order” for those who do not pose a risk of violence. He said that in many cases police receive “really worrying threat information” suggesting that a person is discussing a weapon or planning a terror attack. “But once they’ve gone through the door they may find an autistic child in their bedroom, who is young, has no network and no capability,” he added. “They may find shedloads of terrorist materials and instructional materials, or discover that the child has been involved in huge amounts of encouragement. But it all comes down to their relationship with the internet.”
Hall said that simply dropping investigations at that stage “is not going to help anyone, because they will carry on doing the same thing” and could become more of a threat. But he believes that the current process is not always appropriate.“In practice, I don’t think we really want to criminalise children, but once you get on that train it’s quite hard to get off,” he says.
In a report submitted to the Home Office more than a year ago, he called for the Government to consider creating injunctions that could be imposed on children committing non-violent terror offences that impose conditions for which they can be arrested if breaking. The orders could mandate ideological mentoring, restrictions on phone and internet usage and other measures to control their risk. Hall said he had not had any response from the Government. “My best information is they are continuing to look at it but I’m a bit disappointed that there hasn’t been some more progress since my report went in.”
The ongoing court battles over the removal of Shamima Begum’s citizenship has renewed debates about the role age and “vulnerability” should play in the security services’ response to terrorism. Lawyers for the former Isis member say she was trafficked to Syria at the age of 15 for the purpose of “sexual exploitation” by male militants and could not have legally consented. A Court of Appeal hearing last month heard that Begum’s first two children died as infants and the third, born shortly after she was found by a journalist in a detention camp in 2019, died at less than three weeks old.
Then home secretary Sajid Javid was accused of acting with “extreme speed” by removing her nationality four days after The Times published an interview with Begum in a detention camp.
Lawyers representing the Home Office argue that there were no errors of law in the decision and that the Government did not have to assess whether Begum was trafficked in deciding whether she was a security risk. In stripping her British citizenship, the Government claimed she was a “citizen of Bangladesh by descent”, but Hall called the claim a “legal fiction”. He believes the Court of Appeal, which is still considering Begum’s case, is unlikely to find against the Government because judges have become “reluctant to try and second guess in the [security services’] assessment of risk”.
Hall said the Home Office had been “defending the status quo” because of the implications of reversing the Begum decision for other former Isis members it tried to keep out of the UK by removing their British citizenship. “I think the difficulty with defending past decisions is that you can get entrenchment,” he added. “I completely understand why the Government did what they did back in the day, when you were potentially faced with loads and loads of capable jihadis returning to the UK, but things have really moved on since then.”
Hall said large numbers of jihadis who travelled from Britain to join Isis in Syria and Iraq have since died, and there is no prospect of the “mass influx” of foreign fighters once feared. “We’re talking about individuals, so the position has changed,” he said, while wondering whether the UK could repatriate people from Syrian detention camps and “absorb” any threat they pose in the way other nations have. He said the UK was currently “missing” strong independent scrutiny around major national security decisions made by the home secretary because of changes in process since the late 1990s.
Hall, who previously acted for the government and security services in terror-related cases as a barrister, said judges need to be able to “probe and test and get underneath what governments are saying. In the long run, governments benefit from that sort of scrutiny, and people do as well,” he added. “If judges feel that they have to step back and leave it to the government, you tend to get more misinformation, misunderstanding, and conspiracy theories.”
Hall’s post, which he is due to occupy until his term ends in 2025, aims to inform the public and political debate over terrorism in the UK as transparently as possible. It is a long way from his original aim of becoming a writer, which he pursued initially while studying English at Oxford University. “I did write a couple of chronic plays and I realised I didn’t have the aptitude to be a writer,” Hall said. “I never intended to end up here.”
He was inspired by his father’s career as a “high street solicitor” to go into a legal career, but started off in commercial law before having an unexpected awakening when he was struck down with malaria. The young lawyer caught the disease while travelling to visit his then girlfriend’s family in India in his early 20s and became “really, seriously ill”.
“When I was lying on my hospital bed, I just thought ‘I need to go into something sort of grittier’ than commercial law,” Hall recalled. “I did have a very, very high temperature.”
He diverted his career into criminal law and started off in the courts of Kent, before moving up to London’s High Court. 
A turning point came when Hall was appointed to act for MI5 in the inquests into the 2005 London bombings. “After that I got drawn into this super interesting world of national security litigation,” he said. It was the “sensitive, spooky type stuff”, as he describes it, that led him to getting a call in 2018 from a Home Office official asking for him to apply for the post of Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. “I hadn’t thought of me being capable of doing it,” Hall said, recalling a “really long process of endless interviews” that ended with a meeting with then home secretary Javid.
Since his appointment, he has continued to work as a barrister but no longer for the Government or security services. “It’s really good to be a barrister and to carry on being told you’re wrong, having to argue things and being humbled,” Hall said. “Being the terrorism reviewer has been a big change for me, but it’s been the most interesting part of my career without doubt.”"

Man carrying a placard with Nazi symbols has been arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred
Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in London on Saturday in the latest of a series of protests calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, amid continuing fears over anti-Semitic chants and hate speech.
The Met Police had warned those who gathered at Park Lane for the march to Whitehall that they would not tolerate any behaviour supporting terrorism.
Within minutes of the marchers gathering one man was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred after officers spotted him carrying a placard with Nazi symbols on it.
Around 1,500 officers were being deployed for the protest, which came amid a temporary truce in the Gaza conflict and the release of 24 hostages by the Hamas terror group.
Officers along the route handed out leaflets to provide “absolute clarity” on what was deemed an offence.
Ade Adelekan, the deputy assistant commissioner, said: “This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against any group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who supports Hamas or any other banned organisation.
“We will not tolerate anyone who celebrates or promotes acts of terrorism – such as the killing or kidnap of innocent people – or who spreads hate speech.”
The force had come under severe pressure from politicians over the decision to allow that march to go ahead, with Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, accusing it of showing bias in favour of left-wing protesters.
The Stop the War coalition, who organised the protest, rejected the label of “hate march” deployed by Mrs Braverman before she was sacked by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister.
It asked anyone attending to avoid “any actions that might leave you or others around you open to arrest”.
“We ask that all attending our marches respect these clear anti-racist principles, including in any signs or placards they choose to bring to the march,” the group said in a statement.
The march came as the extremist Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir staged a separate protest outside the Egyptian embassy, where chants of “Jihad” have previously been shouted by its supporters.
The Met said: “This will be their first protest since Oct 28 when use of the word jihad prompted significant reaction. Context matters, but it is a word that clearly causes upset and concern.
“If we think people are inciting violence, terrorism or anti-Semitism – we will act decisively.
Ahead of Saturday, Mr Adelekan said chants using the word “jihad” were causing upset and concern in the Jewish community but were “always contextual”.
A 90-minute march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also due to take place on Sunday, with around 40,000-50,000 people expected to attend.
Scared beyond belief 
James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, said he expected the Met to address the concerns from the Jewish community.
“When a minority in the UK are screaming at us that they are scared beyond belief by what is happening it is incumbent upon UK policing and politicians to listen and respond,” he told the Times.
“What we saw over the last few weeks is the Jewish community in the UK telling us over and over and over again they felt vulnerable.
“The police have to respond to that. In the conversations I have had with senior police officers in the Met and more broadly and in the conversation I had with the mayor of London I’ve made clear it is my expectation that they address those concerns.”
Among those released by Hamas on Friday were 13 Israelis who had been held in the Gaza Strip since the terror group attacked southern Israel nearly seven weeks ago.
They were the first of 50 people to be released from Gaza during a four-day truce that began on Friday. 
Israel also confirmed that it had released 39 Palestinian prisoners as part of the agreement."

As their country unites in the face of terrorist evil, ours is exposing a nasty and divided underbelly
I have spent recent weeks in Israel, and goodness knows this is a country that has plenty of challenges. But one question I have been asked a lot by an alarmingly wide array of Israelis is: “What happened to Britain?” 
Generally, I get protective after this question, and reassure people that Britain is still Britain and that our core of decency remains as it always was. But the response is always the same: “But these marches?” Now perhaps they will say “... and the vote?” 
It amazes most Israelis – as it amazes me – that Britain has seen some of the worst scenes of all the anti-Israel marches across the world. And I say “anti-Israel” for a reason. The first protests in London happened before Israel had even begun its military response to October 7. Rallies were held within hours of the massacres. To most Israelis this is nearly unfeasible. 
What other country would see 1,400 of its citizens slaughtered, 240 kidnapped and countless more wounded for life, and not be allowed even a day to mourn? What other country, having suffered a set of atrocities hardly superseded in the whole history of violence wouldn’t get even one day of sympathy? 
Only the Jewish state. And everybody in Israel knows as much. Pakistan is currently in the process of forcibly deporting two million Afghans. Nobody cares. Bashar al-Assad is in his twelfth year of killing Muslims in Syria and the world’s cameras turned away long ago. Only Israel, when involved in any military action, or even when it is simply on the receiving end of extreme violence, cannot rely even on the world’s understanding. 
And it is in this light that Israel notices the British politicians calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The ignorance of a large number of figures in British political life, from Humza Yousaf to Jess Phillips, can hardly be exaggerated. As it happens, a ceasefire of a kind existed in Gaza. Israel withdrew from Gaza unilaterally, and very painfully, in 2005 – removing every Jew from the strip. They handed over the land and got rockets in return. 
Everyone around the Gaza border and across wider Israel was used to running from rockets to the shelters. But despite various exchanges over the years, nobody ever foresaw the battalion-sized terrorist attack of October 7. It was Hamas who broke what ceasefire existed that day when its legions gunned down young people at a music festival, went door to door in small communities, and burned people alive in their homes. 
I have been to the sites of many of these massacres. I passed by one – the utterly destroyed kibbutz of Be’eri – earlier this week as I went into Gaza. It is a reminder of a dream that once was. Many of the residents of kibbutzim such as Be’eri were peace activists. I have seen with my own eyes the peacenik literature that lies among the blood stains and looted remains of their houses. Their dream died with them on October 7. Not one Israeli believes they can now live with Hamas – a group whose leaders say they want to repeat the October 7 time and again. 
To call for a ceasefire now shows an astonishing lack of military understanding but also a horrific lack of decency. I have watched the Israeli Defence Force manage the evacuation of Gazans from the north of the strip to the south, so that the IDF can try to isolate Hamas and destroy them. It is a righteous mission, though one that is likely to prove incredibly hard. 
I have also met many of the parents of the children and others stolen into Gaza. They want their children back. Why has there been no mass movement of MPs – from Labour, say – demanding that there be no ceasefire until Hamas hand back the hostages? Such a move seems to have never been on the cards. 
Anti-Israel Labour MPs and others only ever campaign and condemn when they attack Israel. Perhaps because they know that Hamas would never listen to them anyway. These MPs are internationalist eunuchs. But my, do they talk a big game. Especially while they whip along the sectarian politics, which are the real driver of the protests on our streets. 
In my view, Israel can look after itself. Watching the unity of this nation at war assures me of that. 
But as I watch hooligans clamber over our war memorials and statues and hold our city centres hostage, I wonder whether it isn’t Britain that is the one in real trouble here. "

Racism or inciting hatred will lead to arrest, warns Scotland Yard as more than 100,000 anti-war protesters set to march in central London
Police will hand out thousands of leaflets to pro-Palestinian marchers this weekend, warning them what phrases and slogans they are not allowed to use.
More than 100,000 people are expected to gather in central London on Saturday in the latest demonstration against Israel’s response to the Hamas terrorist attacks.
Previous marches have been marred by criminal behaviour, with some participants seen glorifying terrorism and showing support for Hamas.
But Scotland Yard has promised a “swift and robust” response to any forms of racism, anti-Semitism, incitement to violence or support for terrorism this weekend.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said Met officers would be lining the route of the march – which will travel from Park Lane to Whitehall – to remind people what offences “would land them in the cells”.
He said this would involve handing out leaflets which set out clearly the boundaries of what is unacceptable and illegal.
“Anyone who is racist or incites hatred against any group should expect to be arrested,” he said.
‘We will not tolerate promoting terrorism’ 
Mr Adelekan also said anyone who was seen to show support for Hamas or any other banned organisation should expect to be arrested.
“We will not tolerate anyone who promotes or celebrates acts of terrorism such as the killing or kidnap of innocent people,” he said.
He urged anyone taking part in the march who witnessed any form of criminality to report it to any of the police officers along the route.
“In a huge march officers cannot see everything that is going but others do. So if they do report it we will act as quickly as possible. You will see robust intervention from our officers in the event of any criminal activity this weekend.”
Police will guard the Cenotaph
Scotland Yard will have trained spotters along the route as well as Arabic translators mingling among the marchers and in the operations room to look out for any criminal acts, including hate placards, banners and clothing.
Police officers will also guard a physical barrier around the Cenotaph in Whitehall and will protect other monuments along the route.
Mr Adelekan said: “We will not tolerate criminal behaviour that disturbs the sanctity of these national monuments.”
As well as the main march organised by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, there will be a static protest being held at the Egyptian embassy by Hizb ut-Tahrir at which several hundred people are expected.
The police leaflets, headlined Keep On The Right Side Of The Law, advise people on conducting a peaceful protest.
They state: “To avoid ending up in our cells DON’T use words or images:
“That are racist or incite hatred against any faith.
“That support Hamas or any other banned organisation, it is illegal under UK law to support such terrorist organisations.
“That celebrate or promote acts of terrorism - such as the killing or kidnap of innocent people.”
Warning not to use flares or fireworks
The leaflet also warns protesters not to use flares or fireworks or use words or behaviour that could be considered intimidating
Protesters are told not to deface or damage monuments or statues.
The first national march against anti-Semitism is due to take place on Sunday with with concern that it might be targeted by pro-Palestinian groups.
Asked about reports that Tommy Robinson, the founder and former leader of the far-Right English Defence League, could attend the protest, Mr Adelekan said he was “not welcome” at the march and would be engaged with by officers.
Around 1,500 officers will be deployed for the protests with several hundred drafted in from other forces through mutual aid."
